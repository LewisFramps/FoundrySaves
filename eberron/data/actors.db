The ooze remains perfectly still until living prey passes within reach, then it lashes out with disgusting pseudopods. With a touch, a slime mold can infect its prey with a foul contagion known as slime rot, a horrific disease that painfully breaks down a victim's flesh. At first, the disease manifests as painful rashes and agonized joints. In the later stages, though, the flesh of the affected creature actually begins to liquefy and run in rivulets as the creature's spores continue to work.

They resemble decaying humanoids, but with elongated arms, teeth, and bone-like spikes protruding from their upper backs. Festrogs' tendency to run on all fours has led to them gaining the moniker dog-ghouls, causing the unwary to mistake them for mindless predators.</p>\n<p>Festrogs are in fact intelligent, stalking victims in packs and choosing hunting grounds that suit their abilities. They can often be found roaming farmlands, open forests, or wide plains, anywhere they can use their quadrupedal speed to overtake quarry. Belying their mindless appearance, festrogs use tactics similar to those of hunters with hounds: the leader of the pack often flushes prey from cover so that the victim can be brought down by the pack.</p>\n<p>Researchers of the necromantic processes that creates risen corpses have found that festrogs spawn more often from slow demises than sudden deaths. Festrogs typically animate from corpses afflicted with disease, while victims of violence are more likely to become more common undead, such as zombies. One documented way to create a festrog is to have scavengers feed on the dead flesh before animating it. This potentially explains why festrogs most often arise in remote areas stricken with famine and desperate predators.</p>\n<p>Though most festrogs arise from humans and other prevalent humanoids, other creatures that die in the same circumstances can rise as festrogs. Festrogs that were once larger humanoids such as ogres, hill giants, or trolls behave similarly to other humanoid festrogs and are simply larger and more powerful. More peculiar are the beastkin festrogs formed of quadrupedal animals, which typically have feet or hooves instead of hands, travel on all fours at all times, and have only animal intelligence. In fact, some humanoid festrogs capture and starve beastkin in hopes of the creatures rising as grotesque festrog pets.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["undead"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["common"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.835,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-05-26T19:58:01.179+01:00","version":{"schema":0.815,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.10.4"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":0},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":6,"saveDetail":""}}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-3.8LBJ0jKca3vLaUhx"}},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Festrog","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"texture":{"src":"modules/pf2e-tokens-bestiaries/tokens/undead/festrog.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":null,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true,"autoscale":true}},"randomImg":false},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"3WjUNOtdq6iPt0l2":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.10.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1676492901759,"modifiedTime":1685127481616,"lastModifiedBy":"3WjUNOtdq6iPt0l2"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"E1U7sSv1831JesPK"}

Early Cannith development of the warforged war focused on the production of warforged such as the warforged titans which were true constructs - machines of war built to destroy, kill, and die on command. With further refinements and arcane experimentation, the warforged evolved until they were a new type of creature - a living construct. This advancement in development was made possible by the creation forges but came with the side-effect of adding sentience to the new construct known only as warforged. However, with their single-minded focus and combat prowess, sentience empowered warforged with a desire to preserve themselves than Cannith's other mindless constructs exhibit - making them a more efficient soldier than simple golems.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the Last War, the Treaty of Thronehold has granted warforged their rights and freedom from being used as bought-and-sold soldiers of nations. This newfound freedom for warforged is a double-edged sword, as many warforged struggle to find a place in a world that no longer cares for them. Some warforged have taken up new employments as labourers and artisans; many warforged have taken on employment doing what they already know and fight fiercely as a soldier. The warforged that fight on have taken roles as guards, mercenaries, adventurers, and some have found their way back into the employment of armies. Warforged in these roles make steadfast allies and fearsome enemies. They fight with a vigour that most humanoids struggle to match - but with the ability to adapt and learn that mindless constructs can not replicate.</p>\n<h2>You might…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have scars and wounds from fighting in the last war, dealing with old injuries and trauma that has never healed</li>\n<li>Often misread other creatures' emotions, struggling to understand their - and your own - feelings</li>\n<li>Apply wartime thinking to every situation, analyzing every situation as a tactical puzzle<br /> </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe you do not experience emotions and are incapable of higher thinking beyond your programming</li>\n<li>Are an expendable asset, and to be taken advantage of for your tireless nature and lack of world experience outside the war</li>\n<li>See you as a valuable ally to have on the battlefield, even if sometimes they struggle to relate to you</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2>Physical Description…</h2>\n<p>Warforged appear to be a completely constructed creature. Their frame is composed of a composite of materials—obsidian, iron, stone, darkwood, silver, and organic material. Around a warforged's frame is a musculature is composed of root-like cords infused with alchemical liquids that grant strength and surprising grace and flexibility to their body. Their exterior is covered in a series of flexible metallic or leather plates, creating a form of integrated armour which grants them protection on the battlefield. This integrated armour is attached directly into their body by the root-like tendrils of their musculature and is extremely painful to remove. Most warforged share a similar facial structure, with a hinged jaw and crystal eys embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. The specific composition and structure of each warforged changes depending on their intended purpose, but all warforged are humanoid in shape. <br />Unique among constructs, warforged have learned to modify their bodies through magic and training. These unique changes that warforged choose helps define their personality and differentiate their physical form from one warforged from another.</p>\n<p>As constructs, warforged typically don't need to breathe, eat, or sleep; however, the body of a warforged needs to vent alchemical impurities at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air to prevent a buildup of impurities in a warforged's alchemical fluids which can seize a warforged's biological components, sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, warforged can still suffocate much like living creatures, but can in a limited sense hold their breath as other humanoid creatures can. Though they don't sleep, warforged require a period of restoration to allow the alchemical fluids of their body to replenish. Without this process, a warforged is incapable of fully restoring their body and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a humanoid who doesn't get 8 hours of sleep).</p>\n<p>Warforged were created by Cannith within the last 30 years, and as a result, their life expectancy is unknown. Older warforged have begun to show signs of physical decay, indicating that they may eventually degrade. Though it is still unclear (and Cannith has never provided a clear answer), it appears that warforged may have innate souls. A warforged's body is as vulnerable to destruction as any other creature's body is, and warforged that have been destroyed require magical intervention such as resurrection magic to restore themselves.</p>\n<p>As constructs, warforged have no concept of gender - nor is their body designed to a specific gendered shape. Though some warforged have selected a gender identity, most warforged are unaware or choose to ignore the concept altogether.</p>\n<h2>Society…</h2>\n<p>Warforged were created as soldiers to fight in the last war, and have only gained their freedom within the last two years. As a result, warforged do not have any established cultures or traditions, or any sort of developed place in society. Most warforged have picked up the culture of the nation they fought for, and others have latched on to bits and pieces that interest them creating a mixed celebration of traditions. Since most warforged struggle to relate to other humanoids, most of the time they will band together with other warforged who provide a sense of familiarity. Sometimes this group is those they fought with in the last war, other times it is simply others like them who decided to settle in the local area.</p>\n<p>Sometimes warforged prefer to lead solitary lives or work to integrate themselves into other humanoid societies. Some warforged wander Khorvaire, looking to find purpose and meaning for themselves and have become ambassadors between cultures.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"page-overlay\"> </div>\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2>Alignment and Religion…</h2>\n<p>Warforged tend to be neutrally aligned. As constructs of war, they were built to fight without questioning orders - though they are capable of doing so. Warforged are capable of emotion and moral reasoning, however, this is something few were trained or practised in and most struggle to comprehend.</p>\n<p>Warforged similarly tend to be unreligious. As a soldier some warforged have picked up the religion of their humanoid companions, beginning the follow the Sovereign Host as a soldier of Cyre, or the Silver Flame as a Thranish soldier, but independently most have not been drawn to religion. Warforged that have begun to follow a religion have sometimes found an answer to the questions of their existence and their purpose in life, but these warforged are few between.</p>\n<p>Some warforged have begun to be drawn towards a messianic figure called the Lord of Blades. The Lord of Blades has begun to gather a cult-like following of warforged by promising purpose to the disaffected and a rebellion against the \"weak-fleshed\" ancestries.</p>\n<h2>Names…</h2>\n<p>Most warforged do not have a name for themselves beyond their creation number such as unit 4859. Only after being able to experience the world outside of military structure have they begun to understand the need of other races to have names for everything. Many warforged accept any name that others give them, and warforged working in proximity to other humanoids are often are referred to by nicknames. Some warforged, however, have come to see having a name as a defining moment of their new existence, and thus search long and hard for the perfect name to attach to themselves.</p>\n<h3>Sample warforged names</h3>\n<p>Anchor, Banner, Bastion, Blade, Blue, Bow, Cart, Church, Crunch, Crystal, Dagger, Dent, Five, Glaive, Hammer, Iron, Lucky, Mace, Oak, Onyx, Pants, Pierce, Red, Rod, Rusty, Scout, Seven, Shield, Slash, Smith, Spike, Temple, Vault, Wall<br />  </p>\n<h2>Integrated Armor</h2>\n<p>Your heritage grants you one type of integrated armour, as noted below. If your integrated armour becomes destroyed, it no longer grants an item bonus to your AC but remains integrated into your body. However, your destroyed integrated armour can still be repaired at a very hard DC for its level, losing the destroyed condition when its HP is above 0.</p>\n<h3>Nominal Integrated Armour</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[pathfinders-guide-to-eberron.eberron-items.mZ363pCsYIZXbOIV]{Nominal Integrated Armour}</p>\n<p>Your body does not have the armour protections afforded to most other warforged.

When it's necessary, you can throw them into overdrive to assist you in combat.</p>\n<h2>Innovation</h2>\n<p>While you're always creating inventions, there's one that represents your preeminent work, the one that you hope- with refinement-might change the world. Choose one of the below innovations. Your innovation's level is equal to your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend 1 day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with a high DC for your level; on a success, you rebuild it. An innovation only works due to your constant maintenance and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price.</p>\n<p>The innovations you can choose from in this book are as follows.</p>\n<h3>Armor</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is a cutting-edge suit of medium armor with a variety of attached gizmos and devices. Choose one of the sets of statistics on Table 2-2: Innovation Armor Statistics for your innovation armor (or choose another set of innovation armor statistics to which you have access).</p>\n<p>Your innovation armor can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as ordinary armor. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in medium armor. Choose one initial armor modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial armor modifications to which you have access.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Harmonic Oscillator</strong> You designed your armor to inaudibly thrum at just the right frequency to create interference against force and sound waves. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to force and sonic damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Metallic Reactance</strong> The metals in your armor are carefully alloyed to ground electricity and protect from acidic chemical reactions. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to acid and electricity damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Muscular Exoskeleton (Power Suit Only)</strong> Your armor supports your muscles with a carefully crafted exoskeleton. When you send your armor into overdrive, the exoskeleton supplements your feats of athletics as well. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks; if you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</li>\n<li><strong>Otherworldly Protection</strong> Just because you use science doesn't mean you can't build your armor with carefully chosen materials and gizmos designed to protect against otherworldly attacks. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to negative damage, or to positive damage if you have negative healing (such as if you're a dhampir). You gain the same amount of resistance to any types of alignment damage-good, evil, chaotic, lawful-that can damage you (note that creatures don't take a given type of alignment damage unless they are of the opposing alignment; for instance, you can take evil damage only if you are good in alignment).</li>\n<li><strong>Phlogistonic Regulator</strong> A layer of insulation within your armor protects you from rapid temperature fluctuations. You gain resistance equal to half your level to cold and fire damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed Boosters</strong> You have boosters in your armor that increase your Speed. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +10-foot status bonus when under the effects of Overdrive.</li>\n<li><strong>Subtle Dampeners (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've designed your armor to help you blend in and dampen noise slightly. When you send your armor into overdrive, the dampeners increase their effect, improving your Stealth. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks. If you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Medium Armor</th>\n<th>AC Bonus</th>\n<th>Dex Cap</th>\n<th>Check Penalty</th>\n<th>Speed Penalty</th>\n<th>Strength</th>\n<th>Bulk</th>\n<th>Group</th>\n<th>Armor Traits</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Power Suit</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>-5 feet</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>composite</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Subterfuge Suit</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>composite</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Construct</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is a mechanical creature, such as a clockwork construct made of cogs and gears. It's a prototype construct companion, and you can adjust most of its base statistics by taking feats at higher levels, such as Advanced Companion. If you use the Overdrive action, your construct gains the same Overdrive benefits you do, and it also takes the same amount of fire damage on a critical failure.</p>\n<p>You know how to spend additional time directing, controlling, or programming your construct innovation for a more complex plan of action. You can spend 2 actions to Command instead of 1 when commanding your construct companion; your construct companion can then use an additional action (normally 3 actions, rather than 2).</p>\n<p>Choose one initial construct modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial construct modifications to which you have access. These modifications alter the construct's abilities or form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accelerated Mobility</strong> Actuated legs, efficient gears in the wheels or treads, or add-on boosters make your construct faster. Your innovation's Speed increases to 40 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Amphibious Construction</strong> Increased buoyancy, rudders, and a means of propulsion like a fluked tail or powerful propeller make your construct able to travel in water. Your innovation gains a swim Speed of 25 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased Size</strong> You built your construct innovation bigger than most. Your construct is Large. If you have this modification and your construct innovation becomes an advanced construct companion or otherwise gains the ability to become Large, you can immediately change increased size to a different initial construct modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Dexterity</strong> Your construct innovation has articulated hands or similar appendages with significant manual dexterity. It can perform manipulate actions with up to two of its limbs. As normal for a companion, it still can't wield weapons or held items that don't have the companion trait, and it can't activate items.</li>\n<li><strong>Projectile Launcher</strong> Your construct has a mounted dart launcher, embedded cannon, or similar armament. Your innovation gains a ranged unarmed attack that deals 1d4 bludgeoning or piercing damage (you choose when you pick this modification). The attack has the propulsive trait and a range increment of 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Sensory Array</strong> Additional sensory devices give your innovation low-light vision and darkvision, as well as imprecise tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Wonder Gears</strong> You map specialized skills into your construct's crude intelligence. Your innovation becomes trained in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weapon</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is an impossible-looking weapon augmented by numerous unusual mechanisms. It begins with the same statistics as a level 0 common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another level 0 simple or martial weapon to which you have access. You can instead use the statistics of a 1st-level common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another 1st-level simple or martial weapon to which you have access, but you must pay the monetary Price for the weapon. An innovation weapon can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as an ordinary weapon. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in simple or martial weapons. If you use the Overdrive action, you can choose to change the additional damage from Overdrive to fire damage. Choose one initial weapon modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. These modifications grant additional weapon traits, sometimes with extra abilities. A modification might give your weapon the versatile trait with a damage type that the weapon could already deal, either from its base damage type or from an existing versatile trait. In that case, if you select that modification, you can instead choose to give the weapon the versatile trait for a different damage type: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blunt Shot (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon innovation can file the edges off your ammunition and adjust the blunt force of the shot to deliver a bludgeoning attack when necessary, as well as to avoid striking a lethal blow with an otherwise deadly shot. Your innovation gains the nonlethal and versatile B traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.</li>\n<li><strong>Complex Simplicity (Simple Weapon Only)</strong> Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). In addition, it gains one of the following traits of your choice: versatile B, versatile P, or versatile S.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic Weighting (One-handed Melee Weapon Only; Can't Have the Agile, Attached, or Free-hand Trait)</strong> Your weapon's modified weight distribution can increase power in exchange for taking more hands to wield. Your innovation gains the two-hand trait, with a damage die one size higher than the weapon's normal weapon damage die size (for instance, a longsword would gain the two-hand d10 trait). Your innovation also gains the versatile B trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Entangling Form (Melee Only)</strong> You've altered your weapon to including tangling wires or straps, or to have a flexible construction. Your innovation gains the grapple and trip traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Hampering Spikes (Melee Only)</strong> You've added long, snagging spikes to your weapon, which you can use to impede your foes' movement. Your innovation gains the hampering and versatile P traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Hefty Composition (Melee Only)</strong> Blunt surfaces and sturdy construction make your weapon hefty and mace-like. Your innovation gains the shove and versatile B traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Modular Head</strong> You've constructed a multi-purpose, adjustable striking surface for your weapon, or you've made special ammunition you can swiftly alter. Your innovation gains the modular trait for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. When you Interact to use the modular trait, you can also choose to give the weapon the nonlethal trait if it doesn't currently have it, or to remove that trait if it's currently nonlethal.</li>\n<li><strong>Pacification Tools (Melee Only)</strong> Softer materials make your weapon suited to knock out instead of kill, and special protrusions let you catch weapons and disarm your foes. Your innovation gains the disarm and nonlethal traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.</li>\n<li><strong>Razor Prongs (Melee Only)</strong> You can knock down and slash your foes with sharp, curved blades added to your weapon. Your innovation gains the trip and versatile S traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Segmented Frame</strong> Hinges, clamps, and telescoping parts make your innovation collapsible and adjustable. It gains the modular trait for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. You can Interact to collapse the item down to light Bulk or to return it to your normal form. When it's collapsed to light Bulk, it has the concealable trait, which grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal the weapon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Explode</h2>\n<p>Your innovation is a creation barely held together by your own engineering, always on the edge of completely falling apart. Though this adds risk, it also means you can coax it to perform far beyond its design specifications using special unstable actions. See the definition of the unstable trait and how it affects your innovation.</p>\n<p>While inventors can learn various unstable actions over their career, all at least know how to make their innovation Explode.</p>\n<h2>Peerless Inventor</h2>\n<p>You are constantly inventing, and your skill at crafting is unimpeachable. You gain the Inventor skill feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Shield Block</h2>\n<p>You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>Inventor Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an inventor class feat. Some features and feats use an assortment of gizmos you keep on your person. For simplicity, these are left abstract, but if you are deprived of your gear for some reason, you might lose access to many feats and features, subject to GM discretion.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Expert Overdrive<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You've increased your skill in crafting, and you can put your devices into a more powerful state of overdrive. You become an expert in Crafting, and on a successful use of Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by 1.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Reconfigure<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You've become an expert in all crafts and are always adjusting your inventions. You can attempt to change the modifications on your innovation by spending 1 day of downtime tinkering with it and attempting a Crafting check, with a high DC for your level. On a success, you can change one modification you've chosen for your innovation to a different modification of the same kind (initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).</p>\n<p>If you have any modification feats, on a successful check you can choose to instead retrain a modification feat to a different modification feat. The new feat has to meet the standard restrictions for retraining.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Inventor Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You develop tricks for using your weapons more effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<p>If you have a weapon innovation, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with your innovation.</p>\n<h2>Breakthrough Innovation<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've made a breakthrough in your field of study and discovered a powerful new way to enhance your innovation. Choose a breakthrough modification of your innovation's type to apply to your innovation. You can choose an initial modification of your innovation's type instead if you prefer.</p>\n<h3>Breakthrough Armor Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Antimagic Plating</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections of your own design, you've strengthened your armor against magic. While wearing the armor, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against spells and to AC against spells. Against spells that target the armor directly (like heat metal), you instead gain a +4 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and to AC.</li>\n<li><strong>Camouflage Pigmentation (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've modified your armor's exterior to let you blend into your surroundings with ease, as long as you stay still. While wearing your armor, you can Hide even without cover or concealment, as the pigmentation shifts to match your surroundings.</li>\n<li><strong>Dense Plating</strong> You have encased your armor in robust plating. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to slashing damage equal to half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Resistance</strong> You've improved upon your initial modification's ability to resist damage. The resistance from your initial armor modification adds your full level, instead of half your level (for instance, phlogistonic regulator's resistance would increase to your level). If you have more than one initial modification that gives resistance, choose which one this applies to.</li>\n<li><strong>Heavy Construction (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've expanded your innovation into a heavy bulwark, and your groundbreaking design ensures you don't take any of the drawbacks for such heavy defenses. Your innovation becomes heavy armor, and your proficiency in your innovation armor (but no other heavy armor) advances to be equal to your proficiency in medium armor. If your Strength score is at least 16, you remove the Speed penalty entirely instead of reducing it to -5 feet. The armor's adjusted statistics are: AC Bonus +5; Dex Cap +1; Check Penalty -2; Speed Penalty -10 feet; Strength 16; Bulk 3; Group composite; Armor Traits bulwark.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyper Boosters</strong> You've improved your speed boosters' power through a breakthrough that significantly increases the energy flow without risking exploding. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +20-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. If you're legendary in Crafting, it instead increases to a +30-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. You must have the speed boosters modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Layered Mesh</strong> You've woven an incredibly powerful network of interlocking mesh around your armor, which catches piercing attacks and diffuses them. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to piercing damage equal to half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Tensile Absorption</strong> You've enhanced the tensile capabilities of your armor, enabling it to bend with bludgeoning attacks. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to half your level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breakthrough Construct Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced Weaponry</strong> You've powered up your construct's weaponry. Choose one of your construct's unarmed attacks to gain your choice of one initial weapon modification, chosen from the list on page 18 or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. The unarmed attack must meet any requirements for the chosen traits (such as being a melee attack for entangling form), and since it's an unarmed attack, it can never meet certain requirements, such as being a simple weapon for complex simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Antimagic Construction</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections entirely of your own devising, you've made your innovation highly resilient to spells. Your construct innovation gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and AC against spells.</li>\n<li><strong>Climbing Limbs</strong> With appendages that can claw or create suction, your construct becomes a capable climber. Your innovation gains a climb Speed equal to half its land Speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Durable Construction</strong> Your innovation is solidly built; it can take significant punishment before being destroyed. Increase its maximum HP by your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Marvelous Gears</strong> Your innovation gains expert proficiency in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival. For any of these skills in which it was already an expert (because of being an advanced construct companion, for example), it gains master proficiency instead. If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, these proficiencies improve to master, or legendary if your construct innovation was already an expert. You must have the wonder gears modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Turret Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary turret. Your construct companion can transform as a single action, which has the manipulate trait, turning into a turret in its space (or transforming back from a turret into its normal configuration). While it's a turret, your innovation is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}, but the damage die from its projectile launcher increases to 1d6 and the range increment increases to 60 feet. You must have the projectile launcher modification to select this modification.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breakthrough Weapon Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced Rangefinder (Ranged Only)</strong> A carefully tuned scope or targeting device makes your weapon especially good at hitting weak points. Your innovation gains the backstabber trait and increases its range increment by 10 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Aerodynamic Construction (Melee Only)</strong> You carefully engineer the shape of your weapon to maintain its momentum in attacks against successive targets. Your innovation gains the sweep trait and the versatile S trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Inconspicuous Appearance (Melee Only)</strong> Your innovation is built for easy concealment and surprise attacks. It gains the backstabber and versatile P traits. If the weapon has light Bulk, it also gains the concealable trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrated Gauntlet (One-Handed Weapon Only; Can't Have the Two-Hand Trait)</strong> Combining your weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can quickly switch between attacking with your weapon and tinkering using your hands. Your innovation gains the free-hand trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Manifold Alloy</strong> You've devised several alloys that contain useful properties of various metals, and you replace a number of parts of your weapon or its ammunition with pieces from these alloys. Your weapon innovation is cold iron and silver. This means you deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.</li>\n<li><strong>Rope Shot (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon can shoot projectiles that split into simple ropes or nets around your foes' legs to trip your targets, and you can climb using the grappling hooks built into the weapon. Your weapon innovation gains the climbing and ranged trip traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Tangle Line (Thrown Only)</strong> Your weapon has an extensible line that you can use to knock your enemies over and quickly recall the weapon back to your hand. Your innovation gains the ranged trip trait and the tethered trait.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Master Overdrive<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your mastery of invention and crafting enhances your Overdrive even further. You become a master in Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 2, replacing the increase from expert overdrive.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Inventive Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Through innovation and experimentation, you've made your inventions more effective and reliable. Your proficiency rank for your inventor class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Offensive Boost<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've made additions to your innovation to upgrade your offensive capabilities. Your improvements make any Strikes that rely on your innovation deal an additional 1d6 damage, with a type determined by the boost you choose. If your innovation is armor, the boost applies to your melee unarmed Strikes and to your melee Strikes with one weapon you choose during daily preparations; if your innovation is a construct, the boost applies to your construct companion's Strikes; and if your innovation is a weapon, the boost applies to your Strikes with your innovation. You can spend downtime to switch to a different boost in the same way as switching your modification. Choose one of the following boosts, with the damage type in parentheses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chill (Cold)</strong> Your innovation rapidly absorbs heat, creating an intense chill.</li>\n<li><strong>Ignition (Fire)</strong> Your innovation shoots out jets of searing flame.</li>\n<li><strong>Jolt (Electricity)</strong> Your innovation jolts foes with charges of electricity.</li>\n<li><strong>Momentum (Bludgeoning)</strong> Your innovation slams into foes with added momentum.</li>\n<li><strong>Saws (Slashing)</strong> Your innovation reveals spinning sawblades during your attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Spike (Piercing)</strong> Your innovation reveals wicked spikes during your attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Vitriol (Acid)</strong> Your innovation releases spurts of caustic acid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to better defend yourself against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert. If you have a medium or heavy armor innovation, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with your armor innovation.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve.

Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Complete Reconfiguration<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>When it comes to crafting and tinkering, you've become incredibly adept at changing your modifications to adjust your innovation's functionality. When you spend downtime to reconfigure your innovation and succeed at your Crafting check, you can swap any number of modifications, swap your offensive boost, or retrain any number of modification feats, rather than one. You still must swap a modification only with one of the same type (initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).</p>\n<h2>Inventor Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Overdrive<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your peerless inventing and Crafting ability has supercharged your Overdrives. You become legendary in Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 3, replacing the increase from master overdrive.</p>\n<h2>Revolutionary Innovation<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You are an unparalleled genius and have discovered a technique that will revolutionize your chosen field-or at least for the time being, your innovation! Choose a revolutionary modification to apply to your innovation. You can also choose an initial or breakthrough modification of the same type instead, if you prefer.</p>\n<h3>Revolutionary Armor Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automated Impediments</strong> Your armor uses electromagnetic fields, subharmonic distortions, or other techniques to make it difficult for those close to you to move unless you allow it. While wearing your armor, all spaces adjacent to you are difficult terrain for your enemies.</li>\n<li><strong>Energy Barrier</strong> Your armor's defenses ablate any kind of energy coming your way. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic damage) equal to 2 + half your level. You must have the harmonic oscillator, metallic reactance, or phlogistonic regulator modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Incredible Resistance</strong> You've improved upon your breakthrough modification's ability to resist damage. Choose one of the following breakthrough modifications your innovation has: dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption. Increase the resistance you gain from that modification to be equal to your level, instead of half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Multisensory Mask (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've built a multisensory mask over your armor that protects you by distorting your figure from all senses, leaving behind only a hazy image, muffled sounds, and so forth. While wearing the armor, you gain concealment against all creatures, even if they are using a nonvisual precise sense, such as a bat's echolocation. As normal for effects that leave your location obvious, you can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. If you use a hostile action, the concealment ends until you restore the mask as a single action, which has the manipulate trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Perfect Fortification (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've outfitted your armor with such heavy fortifications that deadly attacks often lose their edge. Each time you're critically hit while wearing the armor, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:13|showDC:owner] check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This isn't cumulative with fortification runes or other abilities that reduce critical hits with a flat check. Additionally, you gain resistance 2 + half your level against precision damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical Protections</strong> Your armor has so many adjustments and precautions that it can guard against all physical damage. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as persistent bleed damage) equal to half your level. You must have the dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption breakthrough modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Rune Capacity</strong> Whether you've done some dabbling in orichalcum alloys or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 potency armor).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Revolutionary Construct Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flight Chassis</strong> You fit your construct with a means of flight, such as adding rotors or rebuilding it with wings and a lightweight construction. Your innovation gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Miracle Gears</strong> As you perfect your innovation's cortex, it becomes much more intelligent. Its Intelligence modifier increases by 2, and it learns a language of your choice from among the languages you know. Your construct gains the ability to use actions that require greater Intelligence, like Coerce and Decipher Writing. Finally, your construct becomes legendary in two Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills of your choice. You must have the marvelous gears modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Resistant Coating</strong> Your innovation is hard to damage by any means. It gains resistance 5 to all damage (except adamantine).</li>\n<li><strong>Runic Keystone</strong> You've incorporated a device similar to a runestone into your innovation, allowing it to hold a property rune, even though it isn't a weapon or suit of armor. An armor property rune affects your innovation itself if it would affect the wearer of the armor. A weapon property rune grants whatever properties it would normally grant to a weapon to your innovation's unarmed attacks, following all the requirements as normal (for instance, a vorpal rune would only apply to slashing melee unarmed attacks); if the rune affects only ranged attacks, it has no effect unless your innovation has a built-in ranged attack (from the projectile launcher initial modification, for example). If the rune would affect the physical shape or appearance of the weapon or armor itself, like glamered, the rune has no effect when etched into your construct.</li>\n<li><strong>Wall Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary battlefield emplacement. It can unfold as a 2-action activity that has the manipulate trait, changing from its usual form into a thin, straight wall of metal and gears up to 10 feet tall and 30 feet long. The wall must extend through your innovation's original space. While your construct is a wall, it can't take any actions except to use the same activity to transform back, and it can't defend itself easily, making it @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and giving it an additional -2 status penalty to its AC. The wall blocks line of sight and effect unless your innovation has half its maximum HP or fewer, at which point holes in the wall allow creatures to see through and attack with cover, and Tiny creatures to slip through.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Revolutionary Weapon Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attack Refiner</strong> Your weapon makes minute recalibrations after every missed attack to ensure the next lands true. Your innovation gains the backswing and shove traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Deadly Strike</strong> Through precise calculation, you've found the perfect shape for your weapon to deal extreme damage on a well-placed strike. Your innovation gains the deadly d8 trait. If your innovation was already deadly, it increases its deadly die to d12 instead of gaining deadly d8.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Damage</strong> You've made your innovation more powerful than other weapons of its kind. Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). As normal, you can't increase your die by more than one size, so this modification isn't cumulative with complex simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Extensible Weapon (Melee only)</strong> You've found a way to construct your weapon so that it can extend while leaving its balance unchanged. Your innovation gains the reach trait. If the weapon already had the reach trait, it increases your reach by an additional 10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Impossible Alloy</strong> Other inventors claim it's not even technically possible, but you've managed to create several metal alloys that seem to work for only you. These alloys can damage opponents vulnerable to any one of the seven skymetals. Your innovation is treated as all seven skymetals (abysium, adamantine, djezet, inubrix, noqual, orichalcum, and siccatite). This means you deal more damage to a variety of creatures, though you don't apply any of the other special effects for weapons made of those skymetals.</li>\n<li><strong>Momentum Retainer (Melee only)</strong> A special weighted device lets your weapon retain more of its momentum when you attack. Your innovation gains the forceful and versatile B traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Omnirange Stabilizers (Ranged only)</strong> You've modified your innovation to be dangerous and effective at any range. If your innovation had the volley trait, remove the volley trait. Otherwise, increase your innovation's range increment by 50 feet or an amount equal to the weapon's base range increment, whichever is more.</li>\n<li><strong>Rune Capacity</strong> Whether you've dabbled with orichalcum or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 potency weapon).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Inventive Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your inventions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency rank for your inventor class DC increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Infinite Invention<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your ability to adjust your innovation has reached impossible heights, and you can use these skills to make major adjustments in your spare time. During your daily preparations, you automatically fix your innovation if it's destroyed or broken, and you can change to a different innovation (armor, construct, weapon, or other type you have access to) and change your modifications and offensive boost.</p>\n<p>If you have any feats that had your previous innovation as a prerequisite, you can't use them until you retrain the feats as normal. However, it takes you only 1 day of downtime to retrain such a feat into a feat that has your new innovation as a prerequisite, instead of 1 week.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Guns &

While some see them as dour and humorless crafters of stone and metal, dwarves and those who have spent time among them understand their unbridled zeal for their work, caring far more about quality than quantity. To a stranger, they can seem untrusting and clannish, but to their friends and family, they are warm and caring, their halls filled with the sounds of laughter and hammers hitting anvils.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dwarves are slow to trust those outside their kin, but this wariness is not without reason. Dwarves have a long history of forced exile from ancestral holds and struggles against the depredations of savage foes, especially giants, goblinoids, orcs, and the horrors that dwell deep below the surface. While trust from a dwarf is hard-won, once gained it is as strong as iron.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is as hard as nails, a stubborn and unrelenting adventurer, with a mix of rugged toughness and deep wisdom—or at least dogged conviction—you should play a dwarf.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to uphold your personal honor, no matter the situation.</li>\n<li>Appreciate quality craftsmanship in all forms and insist upon it for all your gear.</li>\n<li>Don't waver or back down once you've set your mind to something.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>See you as stubborn, though whether they see this as an asset or a detriment changes from one person to the next.</li>\n<li>Assume you are an expert in matters related to stonework, mining, precious metals, and gems.</li>\n<li>Recognize the deep connection you have with your family, heritage, and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Dwarves are short and stocky, standing about a foot shorter than most humans. They have wide, compact bodies and burly frames. Dwarves of all genders pride themselves on the length of their hair, which they often braid into intricate patterns, some of which represent specific clans. A long beard is a sign of masculinity and honor among the dwarves, and thus a clean-shaven male dwarf is considered weak, untrustworthy, or worse.</p>\n<p>Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25, though their traditionalist culture places more value on completing coming of age ceremonies unique to each clan than reaching a certain age. A typical dwarf can live to around 350 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The ancient surface empire the dwarves once ruled fell long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies. Today's dwarves retain many of the qualities that propelled their people to greatness in ancient times: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in endeavors ranging from battle and craftsmanship to forging ties with family and friends.</p>\n<p>While the distance between their mountain Sky Citadels can create vast cultural divides between various dwarf clans, most dwarven societies share a number of similarities. Nearly all dwarven peoples share a passion for stonework, metalwork, and gem-cutting. Most are highly skilled at architecture and mining, and many share a hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids.</p>\n<p>Few dwarves are seen without their clan dagger strapped to their belt. This dagger is forged just before a dwarf's birth and bears the gemstone of their clan. A parent uses this dagger to cut the infant's umbilical cord, making it the first weapon to taste their blood.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Dwarves tend to value honor and closely follow the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. They have a strong sense of friendship and justice, though they are often very particular about who they consider a friend. They work hard and play harder— especially when strong ale is involved.</p>\n<p>The typical dwarf is lawful good or lawful neutral and prefers to worship deities of those alignments. Torag, god of dwarvenkind, is the dwarves' primary deity, though worship of Torag's family members is also common.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Dwarven adventurers tend to work as treasure hunters or sellswords. They often leave their citadels and subterranean cities in search of wealth to enrich their homeland or to reclaim long-lost dwarven treasures or lands taken by the enemies of their kin.</p>\n<p>Typical dwarven backgrounds include acolyte, artisan, merchant, miner, and warrior. Dwarves excel at many of the martial classes, such as barbarian, fighter, monk, and ranger, but they also make excellent clerics and druids.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Dwarves honor their children with names taken from ancestors or dwarven heroes, and it's quite rare to invent a new name or to borrow a name from another culture for a child. When introducing themselves, dwarves tend to list their family and clan, plus any number of other familial connections and honorifics. Dwarven names usually contain hard consonants and are rarely more or fewer than two syllables.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Agna, Bodill, Dolgrin, Edrukk, Grunyar, Ingra, Kazmuk, Kotri, Lupp, Morgrym, Rogar, Rusilka, Torra, Yangrit</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Dwarf Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Dwarven</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

At 1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique reload action called a slinger's reload, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats. The gunslinger ways are described in detail on page 108. The following ways are presented in this book.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Drifter</strong> You wander across the battlefield, equally at home in and out of the fray.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Pistolero</strong> You carefully maintain your distance at a duelist's 10 paces with pistol in hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Sniper</strong> You practice a methodical style of shooting, striking from far cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Vanguard</strong> You rely on a brutal combat style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a gunslinger class feat.</p>\n<h2>Singular Expertise</h2>\n<p>You have particular expertise with guns and crossbows that grants you greater proficiency with them and the ability to deal more damage. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage rolls with firearms and crossbows.</p>\n<p>This intense focus on firearms and crossbows prevents you from reaching the same heights with other weapons. Your proficiency with unarmed attacks and with weapons other than firearms and crossbows can't be higher than trained, even if you gain an ability that would increase your proficiency in one or more other weapons to match your highest weapon proficiency (such as the weapon expertise feats many ancestries have). If you have gunslinger weapon mastery, the limit is expert, and if you have gunslinging legend, the limit is master.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Stubborn<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You don't like being told what to do, and you don't give up. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you fail, but don't critically fail, a Will save against an effect that would give you the controlled condition, you can attempt a second save against the effect at the start of your next turn. On a successful second save, the controlled condition ends, though any other effects remain. As normal, failing this second save doesn't allow you to attempt a third save on the subsequent turn.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand the best way to utilize your unique weapons. Your proficiency rank increases to master with simple and martial firearms and crossbows. Your proficiency rank for advanced firearms and crossbows, simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects for firearms and crossbows.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Deed<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned a powerful new technique of your chosen way. You gain the advanced deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your special shots become harder for opponents to predict or resist. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinging Legend<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned unique techniques for wielding firearms and crossbows that give you unmatched skill in their use. Your proficiency rank increases to legendary with simple and martial firearms and crossbows and to master with advanced firearms and crossbows. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Greater Deed<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've mastered the pinnacle technique of your chosen way. You gain the greater deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Shootist's Edge<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You make shots others find impossible. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class DC increases to master. When using a ranged weapon in which you have master or greater proficiency, you ignore the penalty for attacking within the weapon's second and third range increments.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things that most people can't detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge or absorb blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Guns &

As they live lives that are frequently cut brutally short, orcs revel in testing their strength against worthy foes, whether by challenging a higher-ranking member of their community for dominance or raiding a neighboring settlement. Many orcs seek glory as soon as they can walk and carry a blade or club, taming wild beasts or hunting deadly monsters.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Orcs often struggle to gain acceptance among other communities, who frequently see them as brutes. Those who earn the loyalty of an orc friend, however, soon learn that an orc's fidelity and honesty are unparalleled. Orc barbarians, fighters, and rangers are prized as gladiators and mercenaries. While some human settlements might be hesitant to accept an entire orc community into their midst, a small handful of orc mercenaries can do the job of an entire squad of human conscripts, so long as the orcs are well fed and well paid. Though the belief that orcs are only suited for battle is pervasive among other humanoids, the harsh orc mentality comes from a long history of conflict rather than a lack of ability in other areas.</p>\n<p>Orc culture teaches that they are shaped by the challenges they survive, and the most worthy survive the most hardships. Orcs who attain both a long life and great triumphs command immense respect.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is hardy, fearsome, and excels at feats of physical prowess, you should play an orc.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Eagerly meet any chance to prove your strength in a physical contest.</li>\n<li>Believe that lies and treachery are for those who lack the strength to seize what they want.</li>\n<li>View dying in glorious combat as preferable to a mundane death from old age or illness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>See you as violent or lacking in discipline.</li>\n<li>Underestimate your intellect, cunning, and knowledge.</li>\n<li>Admire your forthrightness and blunt honesty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Orcs are tall and powerfully built, with long arms and stocky legs. Many orcs top 7 feet in height, though they tend to adopt broad, almost bow-legged stances and slouch forward at the shoulders. The combination makes for a seeming contradiction, sharing an eye level with most humanoids while simultaneously towering over them. Orcs have rough skin, thick bones, and rock-hard muscles, making them suited to war and other physically demanding tasks. Despite the roughness of their skin, orcs scar easily, and most orcs take great pride in the scars they have accumulated. Orc skin color is typically green and occasionally gray, though some orcs have other skin colors that reflect adaptations to their environments.</p>\n<p>Orcs consider powerful builds and heavily scarred skin attractive, regardless of gender. A powerful orc makes the hold stronger, and scars are signs of victories won or hardships survived. Similarly, many orcs consider large, jutting tusks to be more attractive than smaller tusks, since the former make more effective weapons. Many orcs also find tattoos to be attractive, particularly large or painful ones that cover a significant amount of skin.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most orc communities define themselves through two things: pain and glory. Each earns respect in near equal measure, so long as the pain is borne with stoicism. An orc with many scars who walks uncomplaining with a broken leg draws as much admiration as one who wins a great victory on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Power in an orc hold comes from strength or family lineage. The structure tends to be feudal, with weaker orcs working at the behest of the strong. The Hold of Belkzen is the largest such society, and power changes hands there quickly. One mighty orc dying in battle can shake up an entire power structure, leading to squabbling and duels to decide control. Many orcs who tire of being subservient split off to form their own warbands, traveling to new territory.</p>\n<p>Young orcs are typically raised by the entire community. Indeed, it would be almost impossible for orcs to raise their young any other way, since twins, triplets, and even quadruplets are quite common in orc families, as are deaths among orcs in their child-rearing years. Many orc holds conduct ceremonies when a young orc comes of age, typically around their tenth or eleventh birthday, during which the new adults are told what their role in the hold will be. For communities that practice ritual scarification or tattooing, this is often when the young orcs receive their first hold-scar or tattoo as well.</p>\n<p>Orcs fear very little, but most distrust magic. Magic is seen as a tool that bypasses the physical and allows the weak to contend with the strong, a belief that runs at odds with orc values. While they respect the physical might of Gorumite warpriests, and even druids who take on the forms of great beasts, they find arcane and occult magic questionable at best and unethical on the whole. All but the most depraved orc communities see necromancy as a foul art that steals glory from the dead, and their growing struggles against the undead have given them newfound common ground with their humanoid neighbors.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>A common orc saying is, 'You are the scars that shape you.' Violent, chaotic lives in violent, chaotic lands mean that most orcs tend heavily toward chaotic alignments. Gorum, Lamashtu, and Rovagug are all commonly worshiped among orc communities, though less violent holds worship nature deities like Gozreh or gods like Sarenrae, whose tenets of fire, redemption, and glory all hold some appeal to orc sensibilities.</p>\n<p>While there are orc deities, their worship is surprisingly uncommon among orcs. Orcs believe that if a creature has a face and a name, it can be killed, and so their own deities are targets, rather than objects of reverence. Some orc holds teach that the greatest members of the hold can earn a chance to challenge the orc deities for a place amid the pantheon. Most orcs don't waste their dying moments praising the divine or praying for a place in the afterlife, but spitting a blood-flecked warning at their deities, promising a new challenger through broken teeth.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>An orc's drive to overcome challenges and prove themself spurs many orcs to become adventurers, though orcs are more likely to set out on their own or with other orcs than alongside adventurers of other ancestries.</p>\n<p>Common orc backgrounds include gladiator, hunter, martial disciple, nomad, and warrior, plus bandit, outrider, and refugee. Orcs thrive in martial classes like barbarian and fighter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Orcs have a harsh, guttural language, and their naming conventions are no exception. Many orc names are simply the Orcish word for a particularly desirable trait, such as great strength, height, or ferocity. Orcs commonly use either their hold name or a name referencing a particularly memorable accomplishment as their surname.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Arkus, Ausk, Durra, Grask, Grillgiss, Krugga, Mahja, Murdut, Ollak, Onyat, Thurk, Uirch, Unach</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Orc Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Strength, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Orcish</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

You must meet all of the feat's other prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master.

Your proficiency rank for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.</p>\n<h2>Fighter Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've practiced your techniques to make them harder to resist.

When you use combat flexibility, you can gain two fighter feats instead of one. While the first feat must still be 8th level or lower, the second feat can be up to 14th level, and you can use the first feat to meet the prerequisites of the second feat. You must meet all of the feats' prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with armor improves, increasing your ability to prevent blows. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Versatile Legend<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You are nigh-unmatched with any weapon.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.

In smaller groups, the hobgoblin archer also serves as that band's captain.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Hobgoblins may appear to outsiders to be the most civilized of goblinkind, but their civilization is hardly one of kindness and equality-instead, they revel in all that is militaristic, tyrannical, cruel, and destructive. Hobgoblins are singularly devoted to war, and their entire culture is built upon fostering and maintaining conflict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle. Hobgoblins are highly organized, and they work efficiently and effectively in groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or a fully regimented army. Hobgoblin rulers require little provocation before declaring war, and more often than not, such wars are waged to gain slaves or territory. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray, ashen skin.</p>\n<p>Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and obsessed with advancement. Hobgoblins are constantly expected to prove that they're fearless, ruthless, cunning, and strong. Demonstrating such aptitudes is an individual hobgoblin's best hope for promotion through the ranks, but failure leads only to cruel exploitation at the hands of their superiors. Though brutal, hobgoblin society is a true meritocracy, and all hobgoblins, regardless of age, gender, or birth, wield authority and earn respect from their peers based on their skill in battle. Even those individuals who serve in non-combat roles in hobgoblin society-blacksmiths, builders, cooks, messengers, quartermasters, and the like-know that they perform vital jobs that support the larger hobgoblin army, though they rarely rise above the rank of common soldier. Everyone contributes to the larger whole, ensuring that hobgoblin society is the strongest and most efficient it can be, and anyone who fails to do so is culled from the army and this hobgoblin society as dead weight. Hobgoblins don't usually engage in trade with other races, or even with other hobgoblin tribes, preferring to take what they want by force.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["goblin","humanoid"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["common","goblin"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.835,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":2},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":0},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":-1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":10,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":8,"saveDetail":""}}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.KclNszYZ7sjwE9nX"}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"3WjUNOtdq6iPt0l2":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.10.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1685383324746,"modifiedTime":1685383324746,"lastModifiedBy":"3WjUNOtdq6iPt0l2"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"o8BYFDjlaiAsC9YM"}

Occasionally, poppets gain sapience, independence, and a spark of life. Elevated beyond mere helpers or playthings, these poppets are free to chart their own destinies.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Most commonly made of cloth, wicker, and wood, poppets are among the simplest of constructs. They serve as helpers to fetch tools, clean dishes, tidy rooms, or perform other light tasks. Their size and appearance vary, but nearly all poppets appear humanoid in shape and between 1 to 3 feet tall. They're usually roughly made with button eyes sewn onto blank faces, strings of yarn in place of hair, and a simple dress or tunic made from coarse, cheap cloth. Wealthy families sometimes purchase poppets as toys, with their squishy bodies and stitched smiles, to keep their children company. Most poppets can't speak and lack the intellect to understand speech beyond preprogrammed orders. Poppets can become familiars.</p>\n<p>Very, very rarely, a common poppet spontaneously manifests a spark of life-a tiny bit of life essence- and becomes a thinking, independent creature. These events are exceedingly rare; fewer than one in a thousand gain this spark. A poppet might manifest this life essence through a magical fluke in its construction, a brush with ephemeral spirits, or even the fervent wish of a loving child. Whatever their origin, the poppets described here as an ancestry have their own life and free will. They might consider their creators or former owners to be friends, but they acknowledge no one as their master and often leave comfortable homes or workshops to seek their place in the world.</p>\n<p>Sapient living poppets usually refer to themselves as \"awakened\" to indicate the moment they gained clear and true self‑awareness. Poppets might talk about this event as the time they \"popped up,\" \"woke up,\" or \"sparked alive.\" Most poppets celebrate two special anniversaries each year: the day of their initial creation (which, for most poppets, they must learn secondhand or by studying their creator's records) and the day they awoke to true consciousness.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Like surprising others with your unexpected cleverness and eloquence.</li>\n<li>Seek out other self-aware beings that most people might overlook.</li>\n<li>Rely on your harmless appearance to trick others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mistake you for a toy.</li>\n<li>Doubt your ability to handle tasks that require any dexterity or complex thought.</li>\n<li>Wonder whether your mundane form conceals other magical marvels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Living poppets are both humanoids and constructs, which gives them some of the benefits and drawbacks of each category. Their bodies are usually made of wood and wicker, but they can be made of cloth, leather, tin, stuffing, or delicate clockwork. Either way, poppets burn or melt quickly and must take care to avoid fire. They virtually never look alike, as each is created from unique and unusual circumstances.</p>\n<p>Poppets are fully alert and self‑aware when they awaken to sentience; although they might not know much at first, they instantly gain intelligence and consciousness. They must breathe and sleep, and they must consume food and water each day; through a sort of magical digestion they can restore rips, tears, or scuffs in their physical form. Poppets don't age the same way fleshy creatures do, but they slowly wear down in physical form as well as in mental acuity. A poppet that tends to their body and mind (and takes care to avoid fire) can live up to 30 years.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Free‑willed poppets are so rare that almost no such poppet has met another. Poppets normally live with larger creatures, though not always their creators, and tend to get along well in societies sized for larger creatures. Most live in cities because that's where toy makers, clockwork crafters, and other specialists have their shops, but poppets created by lonely hermits or reclusive inventors might prefer a life in the wilderness. Poppets often stay on the lookout for other creatures who, like them, have stumbled into self‑awareness. They might have regular conversations with animated objects, golems, houseplants, statues, or toys, in which they're deeply polite out of a desire to leave a good impression for the time when the object \"wakes up.\"</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Ordinary poppets are built as helpers and companions, and awakened poppets tend to retain this drive to aid others. They're therefore generally good, and more poppets are lawful than chaotic. Some spend their time trying to uncover secrets of their creation, find others like them, or keep out of trouble; these poppets are generally neutral in alignment. Poppets aren't typically religious unless a particular faith defined their creation, such as being made from scraps of Iomedaean altar cloth or woven from reeds around a sacred Gozren pool. These poppets tend to be vocally religious, even zealous, in their faith. Poppets who find religion later in their lives often revere Brigh, Casandalee, or Nethys.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Poppets generally choose their own names, usually descriptive nicknames based on their materials, patterns, size, or demeanor. They tend to pick up and shed nicknames throughout their lives, and they happily adopt nicknames given to them by people they like. A poppet fashioned to look like a particular person, such as a doll sewn to resemble a deceased child, might proudly take the name of that person.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Burlap, Buttoneyes, Checker, Clockwhirr, Fivestitch, Nettle, Scramble, Stuffing, Taffeta, Tattercap</p>\n<h2>Poppets of the Inner Sea</h2>\n<p>Awkward and endearing, poppets are well‑regarded in all but the most insular and superstitious communities of Golarion. They're known to be able, helpful, and loyal little creatures who support a master's work or make an aristocrat's life easier, which is particularly true in large trade cities such as Absalom, Almas, the city of Katapesh, and Katheer. The key difference between ordinary poppets and living poppets, in most people's experiences, is responsive speech. Ordinary poppets usually can't talk; if they can, they reproduce only a few preprogrammed phrases by rote. They normally communicate with strangers via notes pinned to their bodies, like walking note boards. Awakened poppets not only talk but carry on lengthy, expressive conversations, which likely strikes even the most jaded urbanite as a marvelous wonder.</p>\n<p>In regions where an entrenched nobility enjoys flaunting their wealth, poppets are even built specifically as toys. Taldor and Cheliax teem with aristocrats who pamper their children, grooming them for a life of leisure and devotion to family honor. These children have the best and most expensive toys, including poppets in fancy, frilly clothing. Such poppets are sometimes armed with subtle weaponry to fight against kidnappers or assassins who threaten their charges. Commoners in these nations treat poppets with deference and caution, as no one wants to risk the wrath of a spoiled scion. Awakened poppets from these lands sometimes believe themselves members of the aristocracy and can be snooty.</p>\n<p>In nations such as Nex, Osirion, and Katapesh, where magic flows freely, construct servitors are common. As many people expect to see familiars and homunculi in their daily routines, a busy poppet rarely draws much attention. Such poppets are assumed to be on tasks for powerful masters, but they don't command too much respect-after all, if the task were truly important, the master wouldn't have sent a simple poppet. Poppets in these regions can expect to have to wait in lines, pester trade workers to get their attention, or barter like anyone else. They also tend to have simple and functional appearances with few ornamentations and a tendency to look shabby from years of work. Thus, poppets from these lands have a deeper understanding of common folk from spending so much time shoulder to shoulder (or, more likely, shoulder to thigh) among them.</p>\n<p>Some poppets originate from crafted sophistication more so than magical skill. They might be cunning clockworks with interlocking piston‑powered gears or simply wood and wicker with ingenious hinges and well‑calibrated mechanisms inside. Others might look like toy soldiers or have visages of smooth, thin metal. Such poppets are most common in Alkenstar, Numeria, or around Absalom's Clockwork Cathedral. They often worry about rust, grit, or water spoiling their inner workings, to the point of being fussy.</p>\n<p>There are few areas where poppets are outright feared, but Ustalav is one of them. Whispered stories of ghosts or curses tell tales of common objects, or even toys, given dread animation to inflict misery on a household, making citizens highly suspicious of poppets. This belief is unfortunate because Ustalav has more than its share of the creatures; eccentric inventors, professors desperate to prove abstruse theories, and possessing spirits from beyond the grave might give a poppet the spark of life. These poppets learn caution quickly, lest they be thrown into a bonfire or lake.</p>\n<p>Because they're made from fragile materials, most poppets don't last very long before breaking down. A few rare exceptions survive from powerful ancient empires with well‑known mastery of constructs, such as the Azlanti Empire or the Jistka Imperium. These poppets might be incredibly old-older than they'll ever know, as such poppets awakened recently within an ancient ruin usually have no solid recollections of their creators or their original purpose. These poppets pose perhaps the deepest mysteries, as they might hold the keys to unlock secrets of lost civilizations.</p>\n<h2>Poppet Origins</h2>\n<p>It's rare to find two poppets that look alike, but the most significant and defining characteristic of a poppet isn't what they're made of. Rather, it's how they were imbued with life and independent thought. Magic animates most poppets, and those awakened gain their spark of life and sentience when something goes slightly off‑kilter with their enchantment. For unknown reasons-perhaps an accident or a creator's errant tinkering-a spark of life explodes into being, and a formerly lifeless series of nested commands and calculations synthesize together as true thought. The poppet suddenly gains life and self‑awareness, the ability to speak and reason, and a desire for freedom.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a poppet's life essence originally belonged to another being. An errant fragment of a departed soul, psychic impression, or similar ephemeral sliver lodges within the little construct, and the poppet's magic fashions an entirely unique personality around it. A poppet awakened this way might have occasional glimpses into the being who donated this essence, but their life, mind, and soul are thereafter their own.</p>\n<p>The rarest, and perhaps most precious, poppets are brought to life with love. These are faithful assistants or beloved toys that someone earnestly, honestly wished would become \"real.\" There's more magic in the world than found in formulas and litanies, and this wish magic awakens poppets in the best of circumstances: knowing they're cherished and able to respond with love of their own.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Poppet Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Constitution, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Lore</h2>\n<p>Your experience with the unknown, as well as the tales you've exchanged with other thaumaturges, has taught you about strange phenomena of every kind. You become trained in Esoteric Lore, a special lore skill that can be used to Recall Knowledge regarding haunts, curses, and creatures of any type, but that can't be used to Recall Knowledge of other topics. Unlike a normal Lore skill, you use Charisma as your modifier on Esoteric Lore checks. You also gain the Dubious Knowledge skill feat.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you become an expert in Esoteric Lore; at 7th level, you become a master in Esoteric Lore; and at 15th level, you become legendary in Esoteric Lore.</p>\n<h2>First Implement And Esoterica</h2>\n<p>Your implement is a special object of symbolic importance: your badge as you treat with the supernatural and a powerful tool if things turn violent. Choose an implement from the options presented on page 36 (amulet, bell, chalice, lantern, mirror, regalia, tome, wand, and weapon). You begin play with a mundane item of that type, and you gain the initiate benefit for that implement. While an implement is useful to you, it typically has no value if sold. If you acquire a new object of the same general implement type, you can switch your implement to the new object by spending 1 day of downtime with the new item. As you advance as a thaumaturge, you will collect up to three implements and unlock the hidden potential stored within each, so you can mix and match their benefits to suit your situation.</p>\n<p>While your implements are your primary tools in your dealings with the supernatural, you know the value of always being prepared. You constantly collect and carry various smaller mystic objects, bits of materials with paranormal affinities, and items used in folk practices: your esoterica. These might include cold-iron nails, scraps of scrolls and scriptures, fragments of bones purportedly from a saint, and other similar objects. You keep your esoterica in easy-to-access places on your person and are well practiced in brandishing your implement and esoterica together, so you can draw and use esoterica with the same hand you're using to wield an implement.</p>\n<h3>Exploit Vulnerability</h3>\n<p>Exploit Vulnerability</p>\n<p>You gain the Exploit Vulnerability action.</p>\n<h2>Implement's Empowerment</h2>\n<p>The power of your implement can also be turned to the more common task of combat, its power adding to and amplifying the effects of runes and other magical empowerments. When you Strike, you can trace mystic patterns with an implement you're holding to empower the Strike, causing it to deal 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Channeling the power requires full use of your hands. You don't gain the benefit of implement's empowerment if you are holding anything in either hand other than a single one-handed weapon, other implements, or esoterica, and you must be holding at least one implement to gain the benefit.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturge Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a thaumaturge class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Second Implement<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've added another implement of power to your toolkit. You choose a second implement, which must be a different type of implement than your first. You gain the initiate benefit of your new implement.</p>\n<p>While you're holding an implement in one hand, you can quickly switch it with another implement you're wearing to use an action from the implement you're switching to. To do so, you can Interact as a free action immediately before executing the implement's action. This allows you to meet requirements of having an implement in hand to use its action. For example, if you had your lantern implement in one hand, a weapon in the other, and a chalice implement you were wearing, you could swap your lantern for your chalice to use its reaction.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturge Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned the secret ways your weapons work most effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and martial weapons increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Implement Adept<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You have deepened your connection to one of your implements, unlocking its adept power. Choose one of your implements and gain the adept benefit for that implement.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Intensify Vulnerability<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to use your implement to further assault a creature whose vulnerabilities you're exploiting. You gain the intensify vulnerability benefit of all of your implements, as well as the Intensify Vulnerability action.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturgic Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned deeper secrets of the supernatural, and your abilities are harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your thaumaturge class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<p>You also gain an additional skill increase, which you can apply only to Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Second Adept<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've improved your link to your second implement. You gain the adept benefit of your second implement.</p>\n<h2>Greater Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to a wide range of ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Third Implement<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>As you come closer to the culmination of your journey, you gain your final implement, completing your set of three. It must be a different type of implement than your first and second implements. You gain the initiate benefit and intensify vulnerability benefit of your new implement.</p>\n<h2>Implement Paragon<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have unlocked the last secrets of an implement. Choose one of your implements that already gained the adept benefit; you gain the paragon benefit for that implement.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturgic Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've become a master in paranormal phenomena, and your esoterica grow in power. Your proficiency rank for your thaumaturge class DC increases to master.</p>\n<p>You also gain an additional skill increase, which you can apply only to Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to avoid blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Unlimited Esoterica<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your understanding of your esoterica becomes so complete that you can access your mystic tools without even thinking. You can use Exploit Vulnerability or Intensify Vulnerability as a free action, rather than a single action, though still with a frequency of only once per round.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder

For example, Arcana might tell you about the magical defenses of a golem, whereas Crafting could tell you about its sturdy resistance to physical attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Lore</strong> The subject of the Lore skill's subcategory.</p>\n<p>The GM might allow checks to Recall Knowledge using other skills. For example, you might assess the skill of an acrobat using Acrobatics. If you're using a physical skill (like in this example), the GM will most likely have you use a mental ability score-typically Intelligence-instead of the skill's normal physical ability score.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You recall the knowledge accurately and gain additional information or context.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You recall the knowledge accurately or gain a useful clue about your current situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You recall incorrect information or gain an erroneous or misleading clue.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Sample Recall Knowledge Tasks</h2>\n<p>These examples use Society or Religion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Untrained</strong> name of a ruler, key noble, or major deity</li>\n<li><strong>Trained</strong> line of succession for a major noble family, core doctrines of a major deity</li>\n<li><strong>Expert</strong> genealogy of a minor noble, teachings of an ancient priest</li>\n<li><strong>Master</strong> hierarchy of a genie noble court, major extraplanar temples of a deity</li>\n<li><strong>Legendary</strong> existence of a long-lost noble heir, secret doctrines of a religion</li>\n</ul>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"rules":[],"slug":"recall-knowledge","schema":{"version":0.835,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-05-26T19:58:01.258+01:00","version":{"schema":0.815,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.10.4"}}},"traits":{"value":["concentrate","secret","skill"],"rarity":"common"},"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actions":{"value":1},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"deathNote":false,"weapon":{"value":""}},"type":"action","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.1OagaWtBpVXExToo"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"3WjUNOtdq6iPt0l2":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.8","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675611395496,"modifiedTime":1675611395496,"lastModifiedBy":"3WjUNOtdq6iPt0l2"}},{"_id":"rNpGSeZpDpnEy1kQ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/adventuring-gear/backpack.webp","name":"Backpack","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items and the first 2 Bulk of these items don't count against your Bulk limits.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.

This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, additional spells you learn, and additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The bloodlines presented in this book are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.3qqvnC2U8W26yae7]{Aberrant}</strong> A strange and unknowable influence gives you occult spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.vhW3glAaEfq2DKrw]{Angelic}</strong> Holy grace bestows divine spells upon you.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.w5koctOVrEcpxTIq]{Demonic}</strong> A sinful corruption gives you divine spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.o39zQMIdERWtmBSB]{Diabolic}</strong> A bond with devils gives you divine spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.ZHabYxSgYK0XbjhM]{Draconic}</strong> The blood of dragons grants you arcane spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.RXRnJcG4XSabZ35a]{Elemental}</strong> The power of the elements manifests in you as primal spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.eW3cfCH7Wpx2vik2]{Fey}</strong> Influence from the fey gives you primal spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.tYOMBiH3HbViNWwn]{Genie}</strong> Through lineage, magic, or wishes made real, the blood of a noble genie flows through your veins.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.O0uXZRWMNliDbkxU]{Hag}</strong> The blight of a hag has given you occult spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.ZEtJJ5UOlV5oTWWp]{Imperial}</strong> An ancient power grants you arcane spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.5Wxjghw7lHuCxjZz]{Nymph}</strong> One of your ancestors was inspired by a nymph, or perhaps was a nymph themself, and now the beauty of nature lives in you.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.PpzH9tJULk5ksX9w]{Psychopomp}</strong> For good or ill, your ancestors' deeds drew the attention of psychopomps, or you might somehow count one in your family tree.

Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.</p>\n<h3>Reading A Bloodline Entry</h3>\n<p>A bloodline entry contains the following information:</p>\n<p><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Skills</strong> You become trained in the listed skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Spells</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire class feature. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-level spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that level.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Spells</strong> You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Magic</strong> Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using Focus Points or a granted spell from your bloodline using a spell slot, you gain a blood magic effect. If the blood magic offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell level refer to the level of the spell you cast.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sorcerer Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-17: Sorcerer Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3-17), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new level of spells, your first new spell is always your bloodline spell, but you can choose the other spells you gain. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new bloodline spell and two other 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-level version of a spell you already have so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Swapping Spells in your Repertoire</h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sorcerer Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a sorcerer class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Alertness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Defensive Robes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to inflict grave wounds with your most practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled you mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Bloodline Paragon<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-level spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.6SEDoht4dXEJE5SW]{Bloodline Perfection} sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"rules":[],"slug":"sorcerer","schema":{"version":0.835,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-05-26T19:58:00.931+01:00","version":{"schema":0.815,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.10.4"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common"},"keyAbility":{"value":["cha"]},"items":{"2dihl":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/adventuring-gear/spellbook.webp","level":1,"name":"Spell Repertoire (Sorcerer)","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.lURKSJZAGKVD6cH9"},"4r1hh":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/resolve.webp","level":17,"name":"Resolve","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.JQAujUXjczVnYDEI"},"5wsjn":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/alertness.webp","level":11,"name":"Alertness","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.D8CSi8c9XiRpVc5M"},"7nvmf":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/bloodline-paragon.webp","level":19,"name":"Bloodline Paragon","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.feCnVrPPlKhl701x"},"b6ose":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/lightning-reflexes.webp","level":9,"name":"Lightning Reflexes","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.TUOeATt52P43r5W0"},"ds47l":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-expertise.webp","level":11,"name":"Weapon Expertise","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.9XLUh9iMepZesdmc"},"erm0v":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/expert-spellcaster.webp","level":7,"name":"Expert Spellcaster","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.cD3nSupdCvONuHiE"},"i55qe":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","level":13,"name":"Weapon Specialization","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.9EqIasqfI8YIM3Pt"},"jx0fg":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/signature-spells-sorcerer.webp","level":1,"name":"Sorcerer Spellcasting","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.gmnx7e1g08bppbqt"},"pryw9":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/signature-spells-sorcerer.webp","level":3,"name":"Signature Spells","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.VKRjmXxBFLrJK01c"},"q2jao":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/defensive-robes.webp","level":13,"name":"Defensive Robes","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.gU7epgcPSm0TD1UK"},"q8nk5":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/legendary-spellcaster.webp","level":19,"name":"Legendary Spellcaster","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Hfaa7TuLn3nE8lr3"},"qimsg":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/choice-feature.webp","level":1,"name":"Bloodline","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.2goYo6VNbwC6aKF1"},"r346v":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/bloodline-spells.webp","level":1,"name":"Bloodline Spells","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.H6ziAPvCipTPG8SH"},"tr1s2":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/magical-fortitude.webp","level":5,"name":"Magical Fortitude","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.70jqXP2eS4tRZ0Ok"},"zmu64":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/master-spellcaster.webp","level":15,"name":"Master Spellcaster","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.l1InYvhnQSz6Ucxc"}},"hp":6,"trainedSkills":{"value":[],"additional":2},"perception":1,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":2},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"type":"class","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classes.15Yc1r6s9CEhSTMe"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"SS50lkgcEksKsk7o":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.8","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675009613499,"modifiedTime":1675009613499,"lastModifiedBy":"SS50lkgcEksKsk7o"}},{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/choice-feature.webp","name":"Bloodline","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent.

Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1* </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1* </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"rules":[],"slug":"sorcerer-spellcasting","schema":{"version":0.835,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-05-26T19:58:00.931+01:00","version":{"schema":0.815,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.10.4"}}},"level":{"value":1},"traits":{"value":["sorcerer"],"rarity":"common","selected":{"sorcerer":"Sorcerer"}},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"KYqmEt6drWgxKjLN"},"type":"feat","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.gmnx7e1g08bppbqt"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":200,"ownership":{"default":0,"SS50lkgcEksKsk7o":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.8","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675009613505,"modifiedTime":1675009613505,"lastModifiedBy":"SS50lkgcEksKsk7o"},"_id":"VqFehAKg8uRT8SBw"},{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/adventuring-gear/spellbook.webp","name":"Spell Repertoire (Sorcerer)","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire.
