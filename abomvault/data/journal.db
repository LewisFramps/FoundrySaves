Items they don’t have on hand require a week or so to fetch from Lozardyn.</p><p>Lastly, heroes who learn from Yldaris’s shootists gain access to the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.NwMiszlcqNZWtezq]{Drow Shootist} archetype.</p></aside><p>If the heroes dealt peacefully with the drow and earned an audience with Quara, wary drow wardens escort them here and ask them to wait. Various staff bring in chairs from the common area (area @UUID[.sOpC75joa7ldQh6s]{I15}) and food and fungus wine from the kitchen (area @UUID[.o1v9itp6Cep45ZOE]{I16}). The wardens are curious and talkative, as they have little experience with surface-dwellers, but they avoid conversation that sounds like an interrogation—that’s Quara’s prerogative. If the heroes are reticent or rude, the drow simply wait in silence. If the heroes unwisely attack, the wardens call for backup.</p><p>Before long, Quara arrives to greet the heroes, radiating calm command and curiosity. She’s joined by the stern-looking Salaisa Malthulas, commander of the outpost's wardens, and the strange twin drow cavern seers, Bhazrade and Klathor, who remain quietly at a distance. Quara does the talking.</p><p>\"You have the look of surface dwellers. I've never met any of your kind, but I've seen artwork. Strange, you are not nearly as ugly as our art makes you out to be. I am Quara Orshendiel, leader of this outpost. Let’s figure out whether or not we can help one another.\"</p><p>If the heroes rescued Falxi, Quara adds her thanks for rescuing her cousin from \"one of the scrapes he keeps getting himself into.\"</p><p>Quara is sincere in her words and her goals. The seers foretold that surface dwellers would come as potential allies, and Quara wants to believe it.</p><p>Quara invites the heroes to tell their story. She sympathizes with hardships, laughs at humorous parts, and asks questions when she doesn't understand something. If the heroes mention the fulcrum lenses or show her one, she takes an obvious interest. Quara overlooks petty slights or rudeness, but she chastises any overt aggression calmly- once. Her patience isn't infinite, and overly obnoxious heroes are asked to leave Yldaris and not return.</p><p>At the end of the conversation, Quara says, \"You've given me some things to think about. Thank you.\" She then invites the heroes to stay in the overflow lodging (area @UUID[.uEordq4ZgyMwVB7O]{I13}) until she makes up her mind. Quara spends a few hours thinking, then gambles on an alliance.</p><p>She calls the heroes back into this room, either a few hours later or the next time they return to Yldaris. Bhazrade and Klathor are, as before, lurking at the edges of the room. Quara explains the following.</p><p class=\" box-text narrative\">\"I believe you've been truthful with me, so I'm going to be truthful with you. Yldaris only exists at Belcorra's pleasure. It was here when she first created her vast dungeons; at the time, my grandfather was its leader. Belcorra made allies of several groups, including drow, urdefhans to the west, and the deep gnomes above, who have embraced undeath. To each, she gave a large magical lens with strange powers. For safekeeping, I believe. Ours was the Ochre Fulcrum Lens, and it could manipulate emotions.<br /> \"But there was more to the lens. My grandfather told my father, Larathols, who became Yldaris's leader after him. But my father never told me.\" Quara sighs. \"I was never meant to lead. My older sister was to succeed my father. They both embarked on a secret expedition a few years ago. On an island in the great lake, the urdefhan warlord Khurfel caught and killed them. Their expedition had something to do with the lens, I believe, and I suspect my father had it with him. Perhaps he hid it someplace; perhaps Khurfel took it. I don't know.\"<br />  \"Belcorra came to me as a ghost shortly afterward. She insisted I swear Yldaris's support and aid in a surface invasion that drives her even in death. For the good of Yldaris, I renewed the vows my grandfather made. But I've never felt bound by mere words. I won't help her. I'll help you. You're welcome in Yldaris as long as you'd like.\"</p><p>The heroes can ask Quara more questions if they'd like, but she knows little else. Before the conversation winds down, however, Bhazrade and Klathor speak.</p><p class=\" box-text narrative\">\"There is more...\" one of the twins says. They move their mouths in unison, making it hard to tell which is speaking.<br />  \"...you should know,\" the other drow continues.<br />  This plainly piques Quara's interest, and she motions for the brothers to go on.<br />  \"The ochre lens lies in a dark and wet place. Khurfel didn't claim it. Larathols dropped it in the water to deny it to his enemy. He died attempting to learn more of its purpose, more than the partial truth we know,\" one twin speaks.<br />  \"We have seen in a vision that the stones both empower the Ghost Queen and hold the key to her demise. They are slivers of something ancient, alien, evil, and hungry,\" the other continues.<br />  \"We saw eyes of Empty Death!\" they cry in unison.<br />  \"She separated the lenses because, together, they draw the baleful attention of the Empty Death. Even the Ghost Queen cannot withstand the Empty Death when their powers are joined within her. The secrets to the lenses are in the old treasure vault, which overlooks the lake.\"<br />  \"Find the lenses and the answers Larathols sought.\"</p><p>The twin seers fall silent again, and Quara looks back to the heroes. She explains, \"I would say you get used to Bhazrade and Klathor, but one never does. Let me assure you that when they do speak, it's important. This is all news to me, but when their words benefit Yldaris, and you as well.\"</p><h3>Consulting the Whispering Reeds:</h3><p>The heroes might have recovered a book of Nhimbaloth’s lore, called The Whispering Reeds, from higher in the Abomination Vaults. A hero who consults this tome finds references to the fulcrum lenses without a check to Recall Knowledge and without suffering from the book’s curse. The Whispering Reeds speaks of slivers of Nhimbaloth’s essence existing in the fulcrum lenses, perhaps as a means to contact the Outer God. The fulcrum lenses possess different and powerful (but, in the text, unspecified) abilities. Yet the fulcrum lenses are dangerous in close proximity, and even Nhimbaloth’s worshippers fear to bring more than two or three together. Using their powers draws Nhimbaloth’s scrutiny and invites destruction.</p><h3>XP Award:</h3><p>Award the heroes 120 XP for allying with Quara and the Yldaris drow.</p><section class=\"compartment\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Side Quest:</h3><p>Finding the fulcrum lenses and using them against Belcorra is the primary goal of the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. But Quara has a side task that's personally important to her: she'd like Khurfel killed and his rhoka sword brought to her as a trophy. As pragmatic as Quara is, she carries the common drow vice of vengeance. She emphasizes to the heroes that Khurfel would never part with the lens while he draws breath, so defeating him is necessary in any case.</p></article></section>","markdown":""},"_id":"hcb926Op2PfYoVwj","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":3400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"I18.

In the center of the room is a dusty mechanism of copper and silver. It’s missing its lenses but otherwise looks like the framework of a lantern that belongs in the top of a lighthouse. The dust in this room has been recently disturbed.</p>\n<p>This is Belcorra’s most protected vault, holding her treasures and secrets of her past. The books that have been most recently shelved here—as evidenced by the trails in the dust—are research journals Belcorra penned when she was alive. They’re centuries old, but careful magical preservation has kept them from falling apart. These journals describe four fulcrum lenses (in crimson, ebon, emerald, and ochre) that focus Nhimbaloth’s soul-extinguishing gaze across space and time.</p>\n<p>Belcorra’s journal details how she built Gauntlight and created a special framework called the Fulcrum Lattice to fit the four lenses and harness their power. A diagram of the Fulcrum Lattice makes it clear that the device is the very one sitting here. Belcorra expresses some trepidation at using the fulcrum lenses; they each contain a sliver of Nhimbaloth’s essence, and bringing them in close proximity can be dangerous. More specifically, the lenses impart Nhimbaloth’s essence into those who use or are touched by them. Having all four essences imbued at once is sure to bring Nhimbaloth’s dreadful scrutiny. Belcorra had her talented apprentice, Volluk Azrinae, fashion mundane lenses that would allow Gauntlight to function at a diminished capacity until the Fulcrum Lattice and the fulcrum lenses could be installed, on the eve of Belcorra’s assault on Absalom. The Fulcrum Lattice allows all four of the large, heavy lenses to be carried with ease.</p>\n<p>Belcorra’s journals explain that she used only the Ebon Fulcrum Lens in the Empty Vault at Gauntlight’s base, deeming the essence within one fulcrum lens a minimal risk. She gave the other lenses to trusted groups in the lower vaults: the emerald lens to the urdefhans, the ochre lens to the drow, and the crimson lens hidden where her undead gnome minions could protect it.

Belcorra penetrated deep underground to build Gauntlight’s foundation, following the psychic pull of the Empty Vault, a place sacred to Nhimbaloth at the heart of an ancient, subterranean temple. Gauntlight draws upon the energies of the Empty Vault as its foundation and the source of its powers. Within the Empty Vault, Belcorra empowered four fulcrum lenses that, when installed in the lighthouse high above, focus Nhimbaloth’s attention and unleash the artifact’s full power. But the fulcrum lenses are dangerous; they invite Nhimbaloth’s uncaring gaze, and even Belcorra can’t withstand the scrutiny of the Outer God. Thus, though they hold great power, the fulcrum lenses are also Belcorra’s greatest weakness.</p><h1 style=\"font-size:var(--h1-font-size);font-family:var(--h1-font)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--h1-font)\">The Farm</span></h1><p>Belcorra repurposed the massive natural caverns above the Empty Vault for her needs.

She dubbed the place the Hunting Grounds and left it mostly alone, save for building alliances with the communities there.

The second is the Challenge of Despair, where initiates faced their greatest fears. The last test is the Challenge of the Swamp, where initiates demonstrated their mastery over swampland dangers.

If the party lacks someone with Occultism training to get to the bottom of these mysteries, Wrin’s involvement is a possible solution.</p><h2>Examining Dorianna</h2><p>Even the first time the heroes examine Dorianna, she already appears gaunt and pale as if she had caught a severe malady. A character who succeeds at a @Check[type:medicine|dc:15]{Medicine} check verifies that she’s nevertheless in good physical health. The heroes initially find no evidence of any magic or curse upon her. A search of Dorianna’s room discovers that several of her childhood toys have been brought back out for her to play with. Dorianna states vaguely that she just missed them and wanted to play with them again. Dorianna’s nightmares are tenacious; any magic the heroes use to help Dorianna get a good night’s sleep fail unless the caster succeeds at a secret DC27 Counteract check.</p><h3>XP Award</h3><p>Award the heroes 30 XP for taking the care and time to help Dorianna, even if they can’t figure out what’s wrong just yet.</p><h2>Dorianna’s Decline</h2><p>Dorianna’s condition worsens over time. Her nightmares lessen in intensity, but she feels exhausted and anxious during the day. She begins to talk with the Motley Man as an imaginary friend even when awake, eschewing activities with anyone else. Her disposition becomes erratic and childish, and she often scratches absently at her right hand. Her siblings don’t want anything to do with her, and even her parents find her hard to put up with. She’s been afflicted by Ysondkhelir’s outcast’s curse spell, which the heroes might detect or remove normally. If they do, Ysondkhelir casts it on her again the following night.</p><p>With a successful @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:26]{Diplomacy} check, the heroes gain Dorianna’s trust and get her to open up to them. If they have the support of Menhemes Manor, they have a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. Only one hero can attempt this check each day (on a critical failure, they must instead wait [[/r 1d4]] days). On a success, Dorianna insists that the Motley Man is real and discusses one of the following two subjects with them (on a subsequent day’s success or an initial critical success, she reveals both).</p><dl><dt><p>Gifts</p></dt><dd><p>The Motley Man gives her gifts in the form of her old childhood toys, and the best of them is the stuffed griffon. Even a cursory examination reveals that something hard is sewn inside the stuffed toy; characters who open it up find a large, flawless ruby worth 30 gp. Even if the heroes take this ruby, the next time Dorianna dreams, it reappears inside another childhood toy from wherever it is. It’s keyed to Dorianna and doesn’t leave her for long.</p></dd><dt><p>Wrist Writing</p></dt><dd><p>Dorianna absently points out several bruises on her right wrist that she can’t remember getting. A hero trained in Occultism who views the bruises can attempt a @Check[type:occultism|dc:22]{Occultism} check to Decipher Writing. A hero who speaks Aklo gains a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. On a success, the hero notes that the words are related to some dream-traveling rituals; on a critical success, the hero notes the word “Leng” among the bruises.</p></dd></dl><p>Either of these clues points to the involvement of a malevolent extraplanar creature called a denizen of Leng. Leng is a terrifying extraplanar location just past the Dimension of Dreams, where cruel and sinister people called denizens of Leng live. A hero who succeeds at a @Check[type:occultism|dc:24]{Occultism} check realizes the nature of the creature plaguing Dorianna; if the heroes obtained both clues, then any hero trained in Occultism realizes this without a check. Though the heroes might identify the source of Dorianna’s trouble, there’s not much they can do for her yet, because Ysondkhelir doesn’t ever physically get anywhere near her.</p><h3>XP Award</h3><p>Award the heroes 80 XP if they discover a denizen of Leng is involved in Dorianna's malady.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"7amkuLcaZC2gkHFm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.7jWDoRdEDgMxsPDe.JournalEntryPage.7amkuLcaZC2gkHFm"}}},{"name":"The Spectral Seal","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"100\" /><h2>World State</h2><p>@Macro[pDzkFlraunFyBL5G]{D12 - Breaking the Seal}</p></header><article><p>A spectral barrier blocks the only passage from the fourth level of the Abomination Vaults to the fifth.

The manor’s eastern wing contains a public museum of the town’s history. Although this museum contains replicas of the Roseguard’s adventuring gear and even a few common items that the adventurers once owned, the specific icons Otari Ilvashti’s ghost described to the heroes aren’t here.

While the fire distracted the staff, he broke the Cooperative Blade’s display case and fled with the sword.</p><p>After an hour, the staff had put out the fire without any serious injuries and only a few lost books—a miracle the acolytes attribute to Sarenrae’s protection. By the time anyone discovered the theft, Carman was already on his way to a local cave called @UUID[JournalEntry.VZzXckXM0uJEIc00]{Smuggler's Refuge}. It didn’t take long for the town guard to realize that the missing Carman Rajani was the prime suspect. He had pestered the mayor about the sword for years, after all, and a few witnesses saw someone matching his description absconding from the library, clutching his cloak over some long object.</p><h3>Vandy's Request</h3><p>Vandy Banderdash, head priestess of the Dawnflower Library, meets with the heroes when they come to ask about the sword. She can barely contain her rage, although she seems more angry about the theft than the fire. She asks them to find Carman and bring him in alive to face trial and receive an appropriate punishment.</p><h2>Finding Carman</h2><p>Finding Carman shouldn’t be too hard, as he acted hastily and didn’t have time to cover his tracks or prepare a good cover story.

He harrumphs and adds, “Good riddance to that troublemaker. He’ll keep running if he knows what’s good for him.” He doesn’t provide any aid to capture Carman but happily takes him into custody if the heroes bring the smith into town.</p><h3>Blades for Glades</h3><p>The heroes find Carman’s blacksmith shop, @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.5yYs7JNliPnSYLhp]{Blades for Glades}, closed; they won’t find any clues here. If the heroes already had the support of Blades for Glades, they recall that Carman mentioned Smuggler’s Refuge in the past, so it’s a likely hideout.</p><h3>Combing the Town</h3><p>If the heroes ask about Carman’s location in Otari, nearly everyone suggests they go to the Crook’s Nook. A hero who succeeds at a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:20]{Diplomacy} to Gather Information hears about the Smuggler’s Refuge from townsfolk and recalls that Carman spent time there in his youth (as did many people in Otari).</p><h3>Crook's Nook</h3><p>Asking around at the @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.sdNti6BHkPTeO5fC]{Crook’s Nook} brings the owner, Yinyasmera, over to talk. She brazenly asks for a 10 gp “special fee” for food and drinks; heroes who pay up (or succeed at a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:20]{Diplomacy} to Request information) get her to open up about Carman. The blacksmith has been a little too bold to remain in her good graces, and this theft is the last straw. She mentions that Carman has likely gone into hiding at @UUID[JournalEntry.VZzXckXM0uJEIc00]{Smuggler's Refuge} outside of town.

The Motley Man told her they would soon be together on their adventures forever, but he wanted her right hand as a token. Dorianna didn’t hesitate to offer it to him, and when she awoke her hand was withered. She doesn’t consider it a particularly serious loss, since her best friend wanted it so much. Dorianna doesn’t know how long it will be until she and the Motley Man are together forever, and this timetable is intentionally left vague so you can prompt your players to action without punishing them if they fail to reach Ysondkhelir quickly.

But perhaps they thoughtfully debate the issue or even seek other opinions. NPCs in Otari are split on the matter.</p><p><strong>Vandy Banderdash</strong> thinks it’s wrong to bargain with a devil using another person’s soul. She believes that everyone deserves a chance at redemption, even Carman. However, she holds a particular contempt for thieves, as she never really recovered from the betrayal of her sister stealing from her years ago. She doesn’t push the heroes if they disagree with her.</p><p><strong>Wrin Sivinxi</strong> also opposes the deal since she finds limiting a soul’s freedom to be abhorrent.</p><p><strong>Captain Longsaddle</strong> happily releases Carman to the heroes so they can turn him over to the devil. He considers this choice a straightforward way to eliminate a serious threat to his town.</p><p>For once, <strong>Yinyasmera </strong>agrees with the guard captain. She’s had so many past problems with Carman that she’d also like to see him gone, especially knowing that doing so would save the town.</p><p><strong>Mayor Oseph Menhemes</strong> doesn’t take a position but backs whatever choice the heroes make, especially if they’ve been helping his daughter. The mayor believes that the heroes are capable and trustworthy decision-makers. If his opinion serves as a tie-breaker, he leans toward showing Carman mercy.</p><p><strong>Morlibint </strong>doesn’t offer a direct opinion but recommends several stories about dealing with devils (virtually all of which turn out very poorly for the mortals involved).</p><h2>Recovering Carman</h2><p>How easily the heroes can recover Carman depends on his fate in Chapter 5. If they released him, the heroes likely find him still brooding in Smuggler’s Refuge, as he hasn’t yet summoned the courage to depart. He certainly won’t go with the heroes willingly if they explain what they want with him, but the heroes could trick him. If Carman knows what he’s in for, he does his best to flee the area, and the heroes probably have to work with Urevian to scry his new location—which the contract devil certainly makes them pay for, one way or another.</p><p>If Carman is in jail, the heroes can simply fetch him from custody. Longsaddle doesn’t mind turning him over to the heroes, as they captured him in the first place. If they’re up-front about why they want Carman, he’s surprisingly agreeable to turning the scoundrel over to the devil.</p><p>If Carman is dead, the heroes must go to the place of his death to trap his spirit. Urevian explains that the heroes must perform the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gsYEuWv04XTDxe91]{Call Spirit} ritual (which he can teach them) while holding a specially-prepared gemstone (that he also provides). The heroes are responsible for performing the ritual and paying its cost. If they call Carman’s spirit, it’s automatically drawn into the gemstone.</p><h3>Delivery</h3><p>If the heroes bring Carman Rajani to Urevian alive or give him a soul gem with Carman’s soul inside, Urevian flicks a hand toward his desk. All the contents magically pack themselves into smaller and smaller boxes, eventually into a single valise that one of the barbazus picks up. The other barbazu takes Carman (or the gem) in a firm grip, and both barbazus disappear. “It was a pleasure doing business with you,” says Urevian, “I will look you up again, perhaps in a few years or decades. And if you have died in that time... well, I can come find you anyway. You are so delightfully useful. I shall be in touch.”</p><h3>XP Award</h3><p>Award the heroes 120 XP if they make a deal with Urevian and get the devil to depart.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"dVEJIxBXK6Mr30Cn","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.xeGlOyxx6gsR264X.JournalEntryPage.dVEJIxBXK6Mr30Cn"}}},{"name":"Belcorra Attacks","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<section class=\"compartment\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>A Watchful Eye</h3><p>Ghost stories work best when the ghost is an active and terrifying adversary.

As brutal killers obsessed with ending life and existence itself, the urdefhans who regularly emerged from their caves to raid the caverns and lake of the Hunting Grounds were precisely the kind of soldiers Belcorra needed for her campaign. She made a calculated, overwhelming attack to awe the urdefhans, and when the sorcerer called for a parley, the urdefhan war champion listened. Belcorra swore the urdefhans would be the vanguard of her eventual assault on the surface and gave the Emerald Fulcrum Lens to the war champion as a token of her favor until then.

From there, the calignis explored upward, reaching an abandoned shrine of Nhimbaloth and eventually discovering a gug mystic named Urthagul. Urthagul laired in a cave resonating with strange psychic whispers that awed the calignis. Some of the calignis, led by Dulac, revered the gug and his eerie visions; others remained skeptical of Urthagul’s powers. This ultimately resulted in a schism: the self-named Cult of Urthagul inhabits the shrine, and Galudu’s calignis reside in the @UUID[JournalEntry.1vlzl3NJsftNB9Dc.JournalEntryPage.VhKqePYVA3INg8gz]{Lodge} below.

She visited with Urthagul and found that the gug’s strange behavior wasn’t only due to the psychic emanations of the cave, but also because the gug had found the Crimson Fulcrum Lens and communed with the splinter of Nhimbaloth’s essence inside it. Belcorra realized the lens was probably safe in the gug’s claws, but she didn’t want it to end up in the hands of some interloper cult she didn’t have the time or desire to deal with. She tasked her wisp minions to keep the calignis contained within their shrine.</p><p>It frustrates the cult to be apart from the object of their veneration.

They're also already 2nd level! You don't need to make any adjustments to this adventure, as 2nd level characters can begin it without any trouble. Don't allow them to level up to 3rd level until they've substantially cleared the dangers in both of the upper two dungeon levels.</p></aside><h2>Using Experience Points</h2><p>While each level of the @UUID[JournalEntry.YbOS6pQRxoWI0Q56.JournalEntryPage.RBY8Uu8FDdAjmE4K]{Abomination Vaults} is built with the assumption of a group of heroes at a particular character level, each has more than enough encounters for a party to level up. Part of the joy of a large dungeon crawl is the exploration of every nook and cranny, and a party who faces every encounter might gain enough experience points to reach higher levels well before the end of this Adventure Path- and that's fine! Some later encounters challenge a high-level party well enough, even if the heroes have to retreat, rest, and recover less often.</p><p>The dungeon provides lots of freedom to explore, particularly in the middle levels. Let the players gauge whether their characters are in over their heads and retreat (or flee!) if the situation demands it. When the heroes face harder-than-expected challenges for their current level, they earn more XP, and when they face easier-than-expected ones, they earn less. This keeps their progression on roughly the same track. That said, if you want a slower-paced game, Abomination Vaults works well with a slow Advancement Speed (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 509).</p><h2>Using Milestones</h2><p>Story-based progression can be tricky for a giant dungeon crawl since the heroes can move between levels through multiple routes. If you prefer story-based progression, rather than automatically allowing the heroes to level up simply because they quickly reached a lower dungeon level, consider requiring them to complete specific milestones to level up, as detailed in the \"advancement\" section in @UUID[.8aIgvvxLjsYxB1LS]{Chapter Synopses}.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"uGgoAibjz5qhnqmL","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Exploration","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>You should take note of what the players have their characters generally do as they explore.

Links which go directly to items, like the longsword above, can simply be dragged right from the journal onto a player's character sheet. In other cases, especially if there are a great number of different items in one place, we will provide loot actors, like the Waterlogged Chest above. These have tokens which are placed on the scene, hidden by default. They can contain a number of items, and giving these items to your players is as simple as revealing the token. They will be able to open the loot sheet and take items directly from it by dragging them into their inventories.</p><h3>Coin as treasure</h3><p>Coins are the only form of treasure which won't be linked to in journals. This is because there is already an easy way for your players to add coin to their sheets- through the \"add currency\" function in their inventories.</p><h3>Modifying Treasure</h3><p>If you plan to modify the items your players will find, or if you're interested in getting an idea of the sorts of items that they may be able to get their hands on, you can look at the list below. This lists all of the permanent and consumable magic items from each chapter, not including treasure items which are only useful in trade. Of course, your players probably won't find every piece of treasure the Abomination Vaults have to offer!</p><section class=\"compartment\"><article><h3>Chapter 1 Treasure:</h3><ul><li>+1

adventure includes more than 70 different playlists to evoke particular moods, give audio clues, or inspire your players to courageous and glorious battle. While the playlists have been carefully organized in the interest of making them intuitive for use, as with all aspects of running an adventure, preparation is key.</p><p>To provide the best audio experience for your players, it is important to be familiar with the types of playlists and sounds at your disposal.</p><h2>Simultaneous Music and Ambience</h2><p>We did not provide music or pre-set soundscapes for the average combat, but there are musical atmospheres pre-configured for particular map regions. These can be identified with reasonable ease by matching the name to the journal entry for an area. While these entries are not named to match exactly, it should be clear which is which.</p><p>Most scenes have several key musical themes tied with ambience tracks, each balanced carefully and set to play simultaneously in order to build the soundscape for that area.</p><p>If you find the music or a soundscape is becoming repetitive, the playlist folder \"All Floors\" contains music and ambiences you can use to bring a different feeling to an area.</p><h3>Recurring Themes</h3><p>The playlists provided include, and reuse, a number of recurring themes to let you build auditory reminders for your players. For example, whenever a scene involves Belcorra Haruvex, one of her golems, or a particularly potent remnant of her past, a playlist will begin with \"Belcorra Warning\". In places where the essence of Nhimbaloth has had an effect, the audio track \"What Do We Say to the Empty Death\" has likely been left as an ambient sound source on the scene - albeit quiet enough that only the most attentive player should notice it. Throughout the first four floors, Volluk's theme: The Worms March (or Waltz of the Worms) has been woven into the playlists to represent his involvement in that particular sideplot. Making liberal (but subtle) use of tracks like these will help elicit a response in your players when they reach an inevitable combat where the theme is used as they face their foe.</p><section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Ambient Sound Sources</h2><p><a class=\"entity-link\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/ambient-sound/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em class=\"fas fa-book\"> </em>Knowledge Base: Ambient Sounds</a></p></header><article><p>Throughout the adventure, each scene has at least two pre-placed ambient sound sources. Usually centered on the Gauntlight Tower. Ambient sound sources give your players audio clues in proximity to their tokens, and it is important as a GM to know when they will be experiencing those sounds. Before your sessions start, take a moment and familiarize yourself with the sounds your players may experience by checking the Ambient Sound Controls.</p><p>You can stop an ambient sound source from emanating its sound by right clicking it from the sound layer at any time.</p></article></section><h2>Using Combat Music</h2><p>While only a few combat audio tracks have been provided for normal combat encounters, there is also a list of 'major encounter' music tracks which can be leveraged in more serious fights. While a number of these have been chosen for specific encounters, we encourage you to create your own combat soundscapes with the tools available. However, use some caution---due to the use of recurring themes as mentioned above, overexposure to particular tracks may have a negative effect on the sound experience for the adventure. Always know what your players are going to hear (and how loudly) before you play it.</p><h2>Using Ambient Silence</h2><p>A few key places use playlists that do not come coupled with music, by design. These are meant to give a GM opportunity to use the silence as a cue of danger in and of itself. To maximize impact, you are encouraged to use the pause button on a playlist to bring your players warning of an imminent danger, or a feeling of being watched. </p><p>In the depths of the Abomination Vaults, there are dangers around every corner and sometimes a well placed silence can be enough to make your players consider turning back.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"yJnbkL33UerrQWr9","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Keys","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Throughout this adventure, the heroes might come across keys they can use to open doors and other locks throughout the dungeon.

As a result, everyone who grows up in Otari has a healthy mix of fear, respect, and curiosity for the old ruins out in Fogfen and the strange lighthouse that stands at the swamp's heart. As they grow older, townsfolk learn what's more often accepted as truth: that the heroic founders of Otari had slain the wicked sorcerer Belcorra many years ago. For a time, thrill-seekers explored the ruins around the lighthouse called <em>Gauntlight</em>, but today, common knowledge holds that the place has become a haven for pests—no longer a source of active danger or significant treasure after being completely picked over. Nearly 500 years has passed since Belcorra's defeat after all, and in that time, she has only posed a menace to Otari through sinister rhymes.</p><p>Or so the citizens of Otari believe.</p><p>While many old legends about Belcorra are true (she did practice cannibalism, for example, but didn't limit her diet to foolish children), the belief that she's no longer a danger is false. Two years ago, on the 500th anniversary of the most significant event of her life- her family's exile from Absalom for abhorrent rites- Belcorra's spiteful ghost awoke deep beneath Gauntlight Keep. The lighthouse and surrounding ruins presented only the highest level of a vast complex Belcorra had stocked with malicious and malignant creatures: her Abomination Vaults. Belcorra's spite has festered in the intervening centuries, and she hungers for revenge, not only against Absalom for destroying her family, but also the town of Otari and its founders- the heroes who killed her. Belcorra bides her time while she rebuilds, reenergizing the dread Gauntlight and reasserting her dominance over the feral and forgotten monsters of the Abomination Vaults!</p><h2>Belcorra's History</h2><p>The ghost sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex is the primary villain of the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. The story behind her spiteful rage is one of exile and loss.</p><p>The Haruvex family tree both sprawls and surges with sorcery. The family's strongest bloodlines have an aberrant strain, which provides family prestige as well as sorcerous power. Generations of Haruvexes married within the family to strengthen this lineage, and the most powerful Haruvexes lived in Absalom 500 years ago. These Absalom Haruvexes made secret obeisance to the Outer Gods for great wealth and greater power. But none in the family approached the power of their youngest scion, Belcorra Haruvex. Belcorra had been told, every day for as long as she could remember, that she was the harbinger of Nhimbaloth, the Empty Death, and that she was her family's greatest hope for power and prosperity.</p><p>The Haruvexes enacted abhorrent rites in their worship, including bloody sacrifices, and the authorities eventually caught wind of their crimes. The Haruvexes were finally driven from the Isle of Kortos in 4219 ar, forced to leave their estates and luxuries behind. Belcorra was only 6 years old at the time, but as she grew, her rage at losing her home solidified into an overwhelming hatred of Absalom and everyone in it.</p><p>Most of the exiled Haruvexes died in poverty, but Belcorra grew strong and proud. At 17, she interpreted visions from Nhimbaloth that led her back to the Isle of Kortos to plan her revenge. Far above a subterranean shrine to Nhimbaloth called the Empty Vault, in a lonely stretch of wooded coast a few dozen miles from Absalom, Belcorra erected a magical lighthouse and called it @UUID[JournalEntry.YbOS6pQRxoWI0Q56.JournalEntryPage.efRUYLBH9Kf3CLkX]{Gauntlight}. She dug deep beneath it to reach the shrine she had seen in her visions, and while she worked, she began to plan her revenge. She would draw subterranean monsters and violent beasts into her secret dungeons- which she called the Abomination Vaults- and use <em>Gauntlight</em>'s magic to send them into Absalom to wreak havoc. She enacted the first part of her plan, expanding the Abomination Vaults and raising a defensible keep around the lighthouse. She leveraged family acquaintances to acquire powerful retainers and champions to lead her monstrous forces.</p><p>Belcorra was still stocking her Abomination Vaults with aberrations when rumors of her villainy reached Absalom. The @UUID[.Gx2mnbeUctXU7XUN]{Roseguard}, a group of heroes headquartered in Absalom, set out from the city to confront and vanquish her. The Roseguard faced Belcorra within Gauntlight Keep and killed her there. One of the four members of the Roseguard, a rogue named Otari Ilvashti, died in this fight. Grieving their lost friend, the Roseguard left, sealed up the keep, founded what would become the town of Otari, and retired there. They never knew of the keep’s lower levels or the many creatures still remaining within them.</p><h2>Spiteful Master of the Abomination Vaults</h2><p>Belcorra’s spirit didn’t rest peacefully. Consumed by rage and empowered by Nhimbaloth, she arose as a powerful ghost 500 years after her family’s exile from Absalom, the event that so dramatically altered her life. Belcorra now lurks in the deepest levels of the Abomination Vaults, plotting her revenge against Absalom and the heroes who vanquished her. The Roseguard are long dead, but the town they founded remains, and the icons representing their adventuring careers now have the power to penetrate Belcorra’s protections.</p><p>At first, no one in Otari realizes the danger Belcorra poses. Her machinations and her monsters are well out of sight. But before she moves against Absalom, she intends to use her <em>Gauntlight</em> against Otari—the town built by the adventurers who killed her five centuries before. Only Otari’s newest heroes can prevent Belcorra’s vengeance and put her spirit to rest.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"snj2fGhhuxfAInom","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Carman Rajani","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<section class=\"npc\"><article><h2>Campaign Role</h2><p class=\"stats\">Desperate Thief In Over His Head</p><p>Carman’s initial role in this adventure is as a minor obstacle; to bypass the @UUID[JournalEntry.3T1M395V6J75OsEp.JournalEntryPage.5MfX6RVIF7rOroV3]{Spectral Seal}, the heroes need the four icons of the Roseguard, and Carman has stolen one of them, the Cooperative Blade.

As the last descendant of one of the Roseguard, his soul is important to the contract devil @UUID[.t9SSGAP5pW2NpkWh]{Urevian}. Urevian gives the heroes the option to bring the reprobate Carman to him, providing the key moral dilemma of this adventure. Carman’s ultimate fate is in the heroes’ hands</p><h2>Background</h2><p>A descendant of one of the original members of the @UUID[.Gx2mnbeUctXU7XUN]{Roseguard}, Carman grew up on stories of Vol's bravery, dedication, and skill. As a boy, Carman didn't understand why his family's sword was hanging in the @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.AztvvKcx7K7gOXhN]{Dawnflower Library} and not in their house. It was theirs, or so his parents insisted. As Carman grew older, he first worked at Otari's blacksmith's shop, @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.5yYs7JNliPnSYLhp]{Blades for Glades}, and later won the shop in a lucky wager against the prior owner. Yet he couldn't forget his family's sword. Officially, the Menhemes family claimed ownership over Vol's ancient blade but \"allowed\" it to stay in the library in an act of purported generosity that Carman found offensive.</p><p>The summer his parents were waylaid and slain by bandits on the road from Absalom, Carman became a broken man. His work at the smithy became erratic, and he stopped relaxing with his friends and helping his community. With no other direction, Carman squandered his inheritance, spending the money on entertainment, fine clothes, and rare whiskey. He started spending more time gambling and drinking at the @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.sdNti6BHkPTeO5fC]{Crook’s Nook} than he did at his smithy. Eventually the inheritance money ran out, and Carman was faced with a sizable debt. Several owed favors later, he started grifting travelers or hustling them at the knife-throwing board at the Crook's Nook. But his vices still outpaced his earnings from petty cons, and soon he took to outright thievery under Yinyasmera's tutelage. The \"Ace of Blades\" is the moniker given to the best knife thrower in the Crook's Nook, and Carman Rajani has held that title for so long that it's become his nickname among fellow members of the Osprey Club.</p><h3>Mayoral Candidacy</h3><p>Within a few years, Carman had settled into his new life, working as a smith during the day, carousing at the Crook's Nook at night, and occasionally engaging in some petty larceny when his coin purse started to get light. When he heard rumors that people thought he was wasting his life, though, it stung his pride. He resolved to run for mayor against Oseph, to show the whole town that his family was the equal of the Menhemes family.</p><p>Everyone thought Carman's candidacy was a joke. The second time he ran, his platform became nothing more than sharp personal attacks against the Menhemes family; the townspeople felt the joke had gone sour and considered it a waste of their time. He met their jibes with violence, getting into brawls to prove he was the better man. The third time he ran for office, he actually put in effort to help the community. Though he lost by much smaller margin, he took the loss as proof that kindness can't get you any further than your fists can. The fourth time, he tried to force a successful campaign with open bribes and blackmail.</p><p>Oseph won by a landslide, showing up on Election Day wearing the Cooperative Blade as part of his celebratory regalia. Carman finally decided that the magic sword must be the key to his success. Everyone in town knew it brought Otari good luck, so whoever held the sword had the town in their pocket. As Vol's heir, he deserved the sword. He begged Oseph to sell the weapon, but Oseph suspected it was some new scheme- or worse, connected to one of Carman's rumored crimes or debts- and countered with delays, excuses, and price increases.</p><p>Finally, Carman decided he'd had enough. If he wanted his family's sword back, he'd have to take it.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"hv8jCTjoKEFVFV4Q","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Jafaki","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<figure class=\"right\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/bestiary-portraits/ch-06/jafaki.webp\" width=\"320\" /></figure><section class=\"npc\"><article><h2>Campaign Role</h2><p class=\"stats\">Inhuman Alchemist Creating Perfect Monsters</p></article></section><p>Jafaki initially considers the heroes to be little more than annoyances and trusts in others to take care of them. Once Jafaki realizes the heroes are powerful enough to face them directly, the seugathi understands that they would make excellent candidates for experimentation. Unfortunately for Jafaki, this realization probably comes too late.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Belcorra first spotted Jafaki and several other seugathis slithering through the Darklands while she was building the Abomination Vaults. They expressed an eagerness to serve her and advance their own experiments. Belcorra knew the seugathis could improve her forces, as well as expand. She tasked them with building her a perfect soldier, then making armies of them to conquer Absalom. Knowing that perfection was a high price to ask, Belcorra funneled all the resources she could to the seugathis. The seugathis pursued not one research path but many, including fleshwarping, monster breeding, and even dabbling in magical constructs. Belcorra didn’t mind this broad experimentation, as nearly all of it provided her with useful monsters for her growing army. She passed along the seugathis’ innovations to other alchemists and mages who could duplicate the work.</p><h3>After Belcorra</h3><p>When the Roseguard defeated Belcorra, the seugathis nevertheless continued pursuing their objective. Their initial obstacle was a bone devil named Tarkannah. Tarkannah deemed that ongoing duty to Belcorra—to whom the bone devil remained loyal even after her death—meant taking a firmer hand in overseeing the seugathis. Tarkannah tried to constrain and direct the seugathis’ sprawling research. Rather than comply with these unwelcome demands, the seugathis rebelled; Jafaki ambushed and killed Tarkannah and seized control of the laboratories level.</p><p>This assault started a brief war between the devils and the seugathis. For months the two sides fought, but @UUID[.t9SSGAP5pW2NpkWh]{Urevian} soon discovered the seugathis weren’t really interested in expanding their holdings, only defending the territory they had. The two sides settled in an uneasy truce on their respective levels of the vaults. These front lines aren’t absolute; Urevian is happy to permit potential “raw materials” to pass through the prison, and the seugathis’ cast-off creatures often find their way into the devil’s gradually increasing forces.</p><figure class=\"left\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/items/fleshforged-soldier.webp\" width=\"210\" /></figure><p>Jafaki has little concern for the army growing on the level below. The seugathis don’t bother with the imp and zebub spies that occasionally pass through the laboratories, but Jafaki and their colleagues can make marching through with a large army costly or even impossible. Jafaki plans to permit free passage only in exchange for additional concessions to bolster their ongoing experiments, even though Urevian is certain to balk at the cost.</p><h3>Jafaki's Obsession</h3><p>Jafaki's research has seemed to drift over the years through various abhorrent sciences: fleshwarping, reanimation of the dead, selective breeding, or even golem creation. Yet they remain as focused on their goal of creating the perfect soldier as they were when they spoke to Belcorra all those years ago.</p><p>That word has driven Jafaki for centuries. Good soldiers? They’ve created those, and all have died by the dozens or hundreds in the arena. Great soldiers? Some of Jafaki's finest works have been nearly unstoppable. But “nearly” is not “perfect.” Jafaki will pursue perfection for as long as it takes.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"qrb0F1AQ3iIR7Xni","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Urevian","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<section class=\"npc\"><article><h2>Campaign Role</h2><p class=\"stats\">Contract Devil Eager to Make a Deal</p><p>Urevian sees the heroes as an unexpected opportunity and a potential solution.

Always looking to sweeten a deal, Urevian further offered to train Belcorra’s armies and lead her invasion of Absalom—for a price. Urevian knew that Vol Rajani, legendary Roseguard swordswoman and exiled royalty from Nidal, lived in Absalom. The Rajani family has, for reasons even Urevian doesn’t know, special value to certain parties in Hell. In exchange for Urevian’s aid, Belcorra guaranteed him Rajani’s soul.</p><p>When the Roseguard attacked Gauntlight, bringing the soul right to Belcorra’s doorstep, Urevian was in Hell, committing Rajani’s soul to a much more powerful entity—even though he didn’t yet have it. By the time he returned, the Roseguard had prevailed with Belcorra slain. The sorcerer couldn’t fulfill her end of the bargain, trapping Urevian in the interminable process of preparing a surface invasion that would gain him nothing. Worse, he didn’t dare return to Hell without the Rajani soul, and his agreement forbid him from capturing the soul directly or through his infernal proxies, as Belcorra was intended to deliver it. Urevian was trapped.</p><p>Now that Belcorra has returned, Urevian’s agreement with her can be fulfilled. He plans to train her armies and invade the surface, starting with Otari; his spying has informed him that Carman Rajani, whose soul can also fulfill his contract, lives there. Urevian has fully mobilized his devils to train the fleshwarps who’ve come into his realm. Belcorra placed several horrible monsters in stasis, though Urevian doesn’t yet know how to reliably free them and has made that discovery his next priority.</p><h3>Uneasy Allies</h3><p>Although the devils can use dimension door to reach the surface quickly, Urevian’s other troops need physical access, which required him to approach the seugathi @UUID[.qrb0F1AQ3iIR7Xni]{Jafaki} about allowing them through the laboratories. Jafaki feared another diabolic ruse—a reasonable assumption given the seugathis’ past relations with Urevian—and agreed on one condition: Urevian must allow the seugathis to “personally inspect” all infernal forces and make “upgrades and improvements.” Urevian knew this ploy was for Jafaki to get their tentacles on endless research subjects and that the fleshwarper would never sign off on any troops. Urevian is ready to wash his hands of this entire arrangement, but alas, he has a contract.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"t9SSGAP5pW2NpkWh","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Wrin Sivinxi","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<section class=\"npc\"><article><h2>Campaign Role</h2><p class=\"stats\">Helpful Patron Haunted by Spectral Visions</p></article></section><figure class=\"flipx right\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/bestiary-portraits/otari/wrin-sivinxi.webp\" width=\"270\" /></figure><p>Wrin’s primary purpose is to motivate the heroes’ initial explorations and to give them a focal point to gather around. The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path assumes that Wrin is a contact the heroes share in common, so when she notices a strange buildup of eerie light atop distant Gauntlight, it’s natural for her to confide her fears in the heroes.</p><p>As the campaign progresses, Wrin can help the heroes in other ways, such as by performing astrology readings for the heroes to aid them in their explorations. While she won’t give her store’s wares away for free, her establishment is the best place to buy and sell the odd magical treasures heroes tend to find and crave. Wrin can also introduce the heroes to the wonders of the spirit world—her tutelage unlocks the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.mkp6lhBbTASEmKwY]{Ghost Hunter} archetype. Despite the claustrophobia she suffers, if the heroes find themselves in over their head in the Abomination Vaults, you can have Wrin face her fears to brave the dungeon and mount a rescue. Of course, you shouldn’t use Wrin in this capacity except as a last resort to keep the campaign from reaching an untimely end!</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Wrin Sivinxi grew up in the small village of Glitterbough in Kyonin, but a traveler wouldn’t find her hometown if they were to visit that nation today, for Glitterbough was destroyed 10 years ago by demons in the service of Treerazer. Despite the loss of her hometown, Wrin feels no sadness or despair about the event, for none perished in Glitterbough’s fall. In the days before the demon army’s attack, Wrin had a vision of the disaster. She warned her parents and neighbors, and their trust in her visions gave the town the time it needed to relocate everyone in the village to safety. When the demons came, they found Glitterbough deserted, and when they burned it in frustration, they suffered greatly from the magical traps the elves had left behind to greet them.</p><p>When she came of age a few years later, Wrin left her parents and friends, eager to find her own place in the world. As she traveled, she trusted in her visions and her unusual faith in a pantheon of deities associated with space and time she refers to as the Cosmic Caravan, looking to the nightly stars to make decisions for tomorrow. Her knack for finding lost things and gathering strange treasures made establishing her own curio shop an obvious choice, and it wasn’t by chance that she decided to set up that shop in Otari—it was simply the port she’d arrived at when her capacity to carry her collection finally outweighed its portability.</p><p>She opened her shop, @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.jlb4fsKQC57ZjNQ7]{Wrin’s Wonders}, four years ago. In that time, she has become part of the community, even if many of its citizens regard her as a good-natured eccentric. Sales of the strange and bizarre aren’t brisk in the small town, but that’s no matter to Wrin—she’s patient and has enjoyed her time in Otari so far. One day, she hopes to make enough money to fund a trip west, for she has heard tell of an abandoned observatory in the small town of Crookcove on Ravounel’s southwestern coast that she hopes to purchase and transform into a temple devoted to the Cosmic Caravan. But for the time being, she’s content to stay in Otari and sleep under the stars.</p><p>Wrin’s tiefling ancestry is impossible to miss, and it’s something she long ago decided to embrace. Eyes devoid of pupils, small ram horns curling around her elven ears, a thin tail, and fingertips that sparkle with motes of glittering lights leave no doubt that she’s touched by supernatural forces. Yet, her quick smile and welcoming attitude have always helped her to secure friendships during her travels.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"raJDQ95RBqeXxV14","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":-200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Otari Ilvashti","type":"text","_id":"hmllmOvUuS2wnnVT","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<section class=\"npc\"><article><h2>Campaign Role</h2><p class=\"stats\">A Restless Spirit with Valuable Clues</p><p>Otari’s role is to present the tasks necessary to reach the lower levels of the Abomination Vaults described in @UUID[JournalEntry.3T1M395V6J75OsEp.JournalEntryPage.5MfX6RVIF7rOroV3]{Spectral Seal}.

Such visions always relay great apocalypses, perhaps connected to daemons and urdefhans’ lust for great death, but they’re nonsensical and rarely come true. Yet, like all urdefhans subjected to blood visions, Khurfel was absolutely convinced of his vision’s veracity, its outcome terrifying him. He saw the end of his cult, the urdefhans in the Abomination Vaults once sworn to Belcorra but who had mostly forgotten their oaths. He saw that this end would come while he ruled and that he was powerless to stop it. He would be the last war champion.</p><p>Of course, Khurfel kept his visions secret. If the rest of his cult knew of them, his life would be forfeit— but that wasn’t the real reason he denied them. His blood boiled at the revelation. He was the chosen of Abaddon. He would indeed rise to war champion, but he would fight these fevered nightmares. They were another enemy to be vanquished.</p><p>Khurfel’s rise was swift. He was large, strong, and fearsome. When he led his first war band, he achieved victory and slaughter, and when he partook in his enemies’ blood, the haunting visions waned. Within a few years, Khurfel became the youngest war champion in his cult’s history. He swore to defend their symbol of leadership, the Emerald Fulcrum Lens carried by generations of war champions. That’s when Khurfel’s troubles began.</p><p>It’s one thing to lead comrades into battle. Everything not urdefhan is prey. Fighting was simple and visceral. It focused Khurfel’s mind, and it exhilarated him. But being a leader, he learned, was far more nuanced. He had to juggle the jealousies, ambitions, and problems of everyone in his cult, an aspect of his position that he found tiring and dull. Worse still, his blood visions resumed. The Ghost Queen Belcorra returned to tell his cult to be ready, for they would soon have worlds of slaughter when she finished with her plans. His fellow urdefhans cheered at this promise, but Khurfel’s visions dampened his joy.</p><p>His visions showed him that hunting the drow leader, Larathols, would be the first step toward his cult’s demise. However, Larathols provoked Khurfel with his cautious explorations of the great lake the urdefhans claimed as their own. Larathols sought secrets in the forbidden vault—the one the urdefhans had been told long ago that no one should enter. Hungry for another fight and believing he could overcome his visions, Khurfel swam to an island on the lake and there killed Larathols and his daughter. He drank of the drow’s blood and threw the body into the lake so monsters could rip it apart. He had vanquished his foes. The victory was glorious, and his people screamed his name in triumph. Larathols’s blood was invigorating. What urdefhan doesn’t want these things? It’s every urdefhan’s right to bring death and destruction into the world.</p><p>But Khurfel’s blood visions now manifest more frequently, showing strangers who threaten him and drow working against him. He has called upon his cult’s tormentors and blood mages to summon more daemons and strengthen their defenses, but the visions persist. Khurfel is uneasy, and his doubt feels like weakness. The only way to solve a problem is to destroy it utterly—what his people have always done. Still the visions come, and Khurfel is powerless to stop them.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1300000,"name":"Quara Orshendiel","type":"text","_id":"PMfMv2GzieXiY1Oo","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<section class=\"npc\"><article><h2>Campaign Role</h2><p class=\"stats\">Reluctant Ruler</p><p>Quara will likely become an ally of the heroes, as she knows useful partners when she sees them.

She has learned that the ochre lens was only one of three lenses that Belcorra entrusted to allies in the region centuries ago, and she sets the heroes on the trail of recovering them and finding out more. The most important lead Quara provides to the heroes is that her father was headed toward an ancient vault at the edge of the lake, so the heroes can find out more at that location.</p></article><figure class=\"flipx\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/bestiary-portraits/ch-09/quara-orshendiel.webp\" width=\"300\" /></figure></section><p>The heroes might see drow as enemies and assault Yldaris. In this case, Quara does her best to protect her people, relying on the shootist training that still lingers in her quick fingers. She likely won’t trust the heroes with any information after such aggressions, but they might find some clues in her quarters.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Quara Orshendiel never expected to become the ruler of Yldaris. Her father, a wise and prudent man named Larathols, had ruled the settlement for many centuries. She loved her father, not only because he was a decent man, but because he granted Quara the freedom to forge her own path. She loved the swagger and fearlessness of Yldaris’s shootists and grew up fascinated by their tall tales and the way they reveled in their exploits.</p><p>Larathols saw no reason not to indulge his youngest daughter’s aspirations. He was already preparing Quara’s older sister, Galuna, to lead Yldaris when the time came, which Quara always imagined as many centuries in the future. In the meantime, she honed her skills with the shootists. It didn’t take long for her to start inspiring stories herself and to collect the scars that go with them—the most severe of which came from a run-in with a gug, against which she ultimately prevailed. She wore the creature’s pelt for years until it grew too tattered to be practical.</p><p>Quara’s carefree life changed after her father’s and sister’s deaths. At the time, she was carousing in Lozardyn and delighting in its residents’ larger-than-life rumors about her. Larathols decided to raid one of Belcorra’s secret storehouses to gain more information about the magical lens the sorcerer had entrusted to Larathols’s father many years ago. Galuna had gone with him, and Khurfel, war champion of the nearby urdefhans, ambushed and killed the pair. Quara was immediately called back to Yldaris. As the most senior of the shootists and Larathols’s daughter, she was expected to assume leadership of the outpost.</p><p>Quara never knew much about Belcorra or about the secret mission that cost her father and sister their lives. Belcorra had visited Yldaris years before Quara’s birth and made a deal with her grandfather, the vague details of which Quara heard only through rumors. She knew her grandfather played a dangerous game with Belcorra, promising forces that he couldn’t deliver and keeping the arrangement secret from Lozardyn’s rulers.</p><p>When the sorcerer suddenly disappeared—killed at the hands of surface dwellers, rumor said—the problem seemed to have sorted itself out.</p><h3>Visit from a Forgotten Friend</h3><p>Belcorra arrived in Yldaris shortly after Quara came home, imperiously demanding that Quara swear fealty just as her grandfather had. Never one to be much bound by promises anyway, Quara glibly swore to support the ghost because it seemed like the safest course of action.</p><p>Quara immediately consulted with Yldaris’s enigmatic cavern seers and her father’s closest allies to find out what had happened to him. She learned a little bit about her father’s last days, where he had gone and why, and that he’d taken something called the Ochre Fulcrum Lens that Belcorra had entrusted to Quara’s grandfather five centuries earlier. Belcorra hadn’t mentioned the lens when she appeared before Quara—perhaps assuming it was languishing in some Yldaris treasure vault—but Quara deduced the lens’s critical importance.</p><p>The responsibility of administering Yldaris has changed Quara. Her wild days have ended; she rarely drinks and never to excess. However, her freewheeling time as a shootist taught her the dangers of their outpost. She boasts less and has become more circumspect, having learned the lessons of true leadership. Her people love her for it. Quara would be shocked to hear it, but she’s just as well-regarded a leader as Larathols ever was.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"The Roseguard","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>Otari's Founders</h1><p>An adventuring party who made their name in Absalom, the Roseguard defeated the villainous @UUID[JournalEntry.DQepDGIcXuhkYOuU.JournalEntryPage.snj2fGhhuxfAInom]{Belcorra Haruvex} and founded what’s now the logging town of @UUID[JournalEntry.YbOS6pQRxoWI0Q56.JournalEntryPage.7WZr8QhFOSrHPTgU]{Otari}- named after a comrade of theirs who fell in battle against the sorceress.</p><p>Today, the people of Otari honor them on founders’ day, 3 Desnus.</p><aside class=\"av-float-block\"><h3>Members of The Roseguard</h3><p>The Roseguard consisted of the following heroes:</p><p><strong>Aesephna Menhemes</strong>: Aesephna was the party’s healer.

The streams divide the chamber into islands, each covered with lichen, mildew, and mushrooms.

She knows the secrets of the lenses. Three are within reach, one very close. The other lost by Yldaris. One held by the blood eaters.”</p><p>• <strong>Stupefied 2</strong>: “She keeps them apart while she works her petty vengeance, but the essences shall become one.”</p><p>• <strong>Stupefied 3</strong>: “Find the lenses and place their essences together within a host.”</p><p>• <strong>Stupefied 4</strong>: “Join the essences within Haruvex, and she can fall again. This is a promise of the Empty Death, a promise of empty death.”</p><p>The cavern affects aberrations and sorcerers with the aberrant bloodline differently; they don’t gain the stupefied condition but are fascinated while within the cavern.

If the heroes quickly display peaceful intentions, these patrons keep a close eye on them but resume their business.

The morlock patrons all idolize the band Shadow Malice and bring them up in conversation.</p><section class=\"compartment\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Battle of the Bands</h3><p>If the heroes seem curious about Shadow Malice (regardless of the band’s presence), the morlocks all start chanting the band’s name and “Challengers!” in Undercommon. It might seem like the morlocks intend to set up the heroes to fight against the band, but they call for a battle of entertainment, not of weapons.

A band member provides the best solo performance they can on their instrument of choice, then the paired hero can attempt a DC 22 check with a relevant skill, such as Performance, Acrobatics, Athletics, or any you deem appropriate to impress a crowd. (This DC is the Performance DC of the band member, which is 22 for all of them).

Shadow Malice performs a high-energy musical number, then passes over their instruments for the heroes to use (if the heroes don’t have any instruments of their own). Unlike the individual contests, this phase requires a Performance check. If the heroes balk, Ryta grins and says, \"This stage is for performers, friends.\"</p><p>To compete, one hero must attempt a @Check[type:performance|dc:22]{Performance} check. This hero is the lead performer. Any number of other heroes can Aid at this check. In addition, the lead performer's Performance check gets a +2 bonus for each hero who got a critical success in the individual phase, a +1 bonus for each hero who got a success in the individual phase, and a –1 penalty for each hero who got a critical failure in the individual phase.</p><p>Unlike the normal rules for bonuses, these bonuses to the Performance check are cumulative with each other.</p></article><article><h3>Heroes win</h3><p>If the lead performer succeeds at this final Performance check, Ryta acknowledges that the heroes are Shadow Malice's superiors on the stage and resolves to leave them alone. Word gets back to Vischari about the heroes' success, and the tavern manager treats them with a modicum of respect.</p><p>On a critical success, Ryta gives the heroes the group's instruments, insisting that the instruments belong in the hands of such talented performers. The other members of Shadow Malice grumble at this decision but sullenly comply.</p></article><article><h3>Heroes Lose</h3><p>If the lead performer fails at this final Performance check, Shadow Malice sees the heroes as being out of their depth and resolves to attack the heroes right on the stage, as described in the encounter in area @UUID[.w7j4LONWc9tgS5ci]{F18}. Anyone remaining in the tavern simply watches the fight, considering it a bloody part of the show.</p><p>On a critical failure, the patrons join the fight after the first round, which means the heroes should likely make a hasty retreat before getting overwhelmed.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>XP Award</h3><p>If the heroes participate in the challenge against Shadow Malice, award them the usual 30 XP for completing a side quest.

She constantly mumbles and murmurs about “the man in colored rags who takes hands.” Other attempts at conversation with her prove unintelligible. Before Ysondkhelir discovered the psychic human girl, Dorianna Menhemes, he amused himself by tormenting Jedzeli’s dreams. With a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:22]{Perception} check, a hero who has interacted with Dorianna notices some disturbing similarities with the way Jedzeli mutters about the “man in colored rags.” Helping Jedzeli reclaim her sanity is a long and difficult road outside the scope of this adventure, but Glashdrumdur offers to look out for her if the heroes set them both free.</p>\n<h3>XP Award</h3>\n<p>Award the heroes 30 XP for each prisoner they set free and help to reach an exit to the Abomination Vaults.</p>\n<section class=\"box-text treasure\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/icons/treasure/coin-pouch.webp\" width=\"100\" />\n<h2>Treasure</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.FL8QU8TcNauBMMhD]{Belladonna Poison}</p>\n</header>\n<article>\n<p>While nothing in this kitchen is suitable for consumption by anyone but perhaps a goblin, a large jar labeled \"deadly nightshade\" lies at the bottom of one of the mushroom baskets.

It’s written in Aklo, and a hero who spends 8 hours reading it learns of her family history from their exile to poverty and her eventual return to the region to build a lair from which she hoped to exact revenge on the city that disgraced and impoverished her family. The last several pages of the journal document much of her work in building the Abomination Vaults. While the journal doesn’t offer many specific details, it mentions construction of fleshwarping laboratories, arenas where she pitted enemies against monstrous champions for her amusement, prisons, torture chambers, links to the Darklands, and a great temple where “once the Empty Death herself brushed against this fragile world.” Belcorra’s entries often speak of her minions in the abstract, as if bragging about how many have come to serve her in creating the complex, but she only ever mentions one by name: her “amusingly vain” apprentice, Volluk Azrinae. One of the last entries describes how this apprentice arrived from “a community of upstart and meddlesome drow below” to serve Belcorra. The notes don’t provide any further information about this drow community.</p><h3>Gauntlight Blueprints</h3><p>The stack of loose papers and scrolls contain a wealth of information about @UUID[JournalEntry.YbOS6pQRxoWI0Q56.JournalEntryPage.efRUYLBH9Kf3CLkX]{Gauntlight}.

The folio details Belcorra's series of linked @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.5ZW1w9f4gWlSIuWA]{Teleportation Circles} to quickly move around the Abomination Vaults, and it notes the importance of using the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.AkF4yFcSCdhoULyZ]{Awaken Portal} ritual to activate them should time or mischance deplete them of power.

Otari can’t leave this area, and since the heroes are the first potentially helpful adventurers to visit his haunted remains, he's eager to provide help.</p><section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><img src=\"icons/tools/navigation/spyglass-telescope-brass.webp\" width=\"100\" /><section><h2>Encounter</h2><h2>Severe 4</h2></section><section><div><p>@Actor[wRQ7TZdd0n5UIIao]{Will-o'-Wisp} @Actor[x3eOZvKUginj5Blh]{Flickerwisps (2)}</p></div><p>120 XP</p></section></header><article><p>Before Otari can speak to the heroes, a will-o'-wisp and two flickerwisps that have tormented him for years dart forth to protect their fear-laden victim.

It volunteered to aid Belcorra as a guardian of the upper shrine (area @UUID[.CGaM81kBLtYIxmqu]{D13}), but once she relocated her personal effects to deeper within the Abomination Vaults, it took over these rooms.

The voidglutton helped her refine the plans to testing Gauntlight and has recently done so with Volluk's aid (as the heroes experienced at the beginning of Chapter 2).

The creature has no interest in negotiation; it attacks at once and fights to the death, but it doesn't pursue heroes who flee these rooms.

Lit braziers cast strange shadows on the walls and bathe the room in a sinister light. Bookshelves and a sturdy desk, accompanied by neatly rolled-up scrolls and stacks of parchment, fill an alcove to the north.</p><p>Urevian made this room his home, sealed off from the rest of the dungeon so that he can work in peace. He fashioned the door for himself, but he had to manufacture a magical pendant for Belcorra so she could bypass it. Shortly before Belcorra’s death, Urevian had the imp Szek steal the pendant back. Urevian broke it into five pieces, giving one to each of his lieutenants. His trusted devils can come and go as they please, but even they know not to bother Urevian barring official business.</p><p>The desk contains reports, inventories, and maps that depict the surface world, Gauntlight, and the surrounding Darklands. Of particular note to the heroes are complete maps of the fifth, sixth, and seventh levels of the Abomination Vaults, including all secret doors on those levels. The characters can also find copies of several infernal contracts, the originals of which are safely stored in Hell’s vaults. A character who Investigates the desk and succeeds at a @Check[type:society|dc:23]{Society} or Legal Lore check realizes that Urevian has kept tabs on Vol Rajani’s line for generations.</p><p>The phistophilus Urevian spends most of his time revising attack plans based on numerous contingencies. He keeps two barbazu bodyguards nearby at all times to intercept reports from his lieutenants and to keep him from being disturbed. When the heroes open the doors, the barbazus spring forward, but Urevian stops them and warmly greets the heroes. Read or paraphrase the following.</p><p class=\" box-text narrative\">As a ruggedly handsome devil steps forward, as the long rolls of parchment hanging from his horns curl up, then unroll again.<br />\"Friends, friends! Weapons away. Truly, I am happy to see you.\" The devil turns to the two bearded devil bodyguards, their glaives raised. \"Stand down, you two. I doubt they are arrogant enough to fight us.\"<br />\"I am Urevian, phistophilus and contracted agent of Belcorra, but I assure you I am no enemy of yours. You seek to vanquish her? Put an end to her murderous spirit, the threat she poses to mortal life, et cetera, et cetera? Then perhaps we can broker a deal- one that greatly benefits both of us with a minimal number of precious lives lost.\"</p><p>If the heroes already encountered Szek and made an agreement with her- which Urevian doesn't really mind- he adds, \"You already struck a bargain with Szek, so I know it is not a matter of if, but of what price. Trust me when I say, I am offering you an excellent deal.\" For this conversation, refer to the following list of likely questions and Urevian responses.</p><dl><dt><p>Who are you?</p></dt><dd><p>\"I am Urevian, a contract devil of some renown, if I do say so myself.\"</p></dd><dt><p>What do you want from us?</p></dt><dd><p>\"Simply put, you are the third-party agents I need to get out of this dreadful place and return home. You see, there is something I want but am not allowed to go and get myself, nor can I employ any infernal agents to retrieve it. No, the hands of a mortal foe of Belcorra must deliver me my prize. My devils are valueless in this regard, as are my fleshwarp soldiers\"</p></dd><dt><p>Why does it have to be a mortal foe of Belcorra?</p></dt><dd><p>\"That is the delight of legalistic contract interpretation. It cannot be me, any of my minions, or any ally of Belcorra. The contract was written with the intent that Belcorra alone could give me the prize as my payment. Which, of course, she will not until I have given her the full measure of service the contract requires. However, a very technical reading means any of her foes can also provide it- and you have thus far conclusively demonstrated that you oppose her.\"</p></dd><dt><p>What is it that you want?</p></dt><dd><p>\"I require the soul of Carman Rajani. In his living body, if possible, though I can make do should he... perish.\"</p></dd><dt><p>What do you want with Carman's soul?</p></dt><dd><p>\"I owe the soul of a Rajani to someone much more powerful than myself.

I say it is a lesser evil to turn over the soul of one corrupted individual than to allow an entire town's destruction. Far less bloodshed on all sides. I do not want to raze Otari, and I don't want to kill you. However, the contract I have with Belcorra requires that as long as I remain within her employ, I must pursue the domination of the surface world and the destruction of her enemies. Once my contract ends, so does my obligation to her. All I need is the soul of Carman Rajani to fulfill the contract.</p></dd><dt><p>How's Carman Rajani corrupted?</p></dt><dd><p>\"Oh, that bastard of a man.

A bright light shines down into the center of each chamber. A catwalk 10 feet above the ground circles around the edge of the room without handrail or banister; at the western side, each stops at a staircase leading down.</p>\n<p>Belcorra kept dangerous creatures in this room prior to teleporting them via Gauntlight’s beam. Each cell is 10 feet square, 20 feet tall, and made of transparent stone. Each creature stands motionless in its own column, held in suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creatures haven’t aged and ignore any effect from the normal timestream as long as they stay imprisoned within their stasis chambers. However, such effects can work on the pillars, which are made of transparent, magically enhanced stone (Hardness 18, HP 76).</p>\n<h3>Occupied Chambers</h3>\n<p>Ten pillars are occupied. Nine contain living creatures: a @Actor[aD76W2uEQhFFUrom]{Chuul}, a @Actor[B7eLG2k7qUo8HU6O]{Drider}, three @Actor[xdIHvCBspeSXRL6A]{Ghonhatines}, a @Actor[dEAneTvoPuQXZoLR]{Gibbering Mouther}, a @Actor[T6vOuhM1KV5Fr75F]{Gibtanius}, and two @Actor[zq18QX6CBJNeUIgG]{Gugs}.

On a failure, the creature returns to normal time and attacks anything in sight until destroyed. (High-level monsters, such as the ghonhatines, pose a serious danger even for 7th-level characters!)</p>\n<h3>Empty Chambers</h3>\n<p>Of the five empty stasis chambers, two are noteworthy.</p>\n<p>The northwest chamber appears badly blackened, as though from soot on the inside. After the error with the gogiteth, Belcorra appointed a hag to oversee this room, knowing that her magical expertise would prove invaluable in maintaining the stasis chambers, but she didn’t intend the hag to do this job in life. Belcorra trapped the hag in this pillar, burned her to death, and bound her spirit as a witchfire. A creature entering a square adjacent to this blackened pillar receives a brief telepathic flash of Belcorra burning the hag alive and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against the witchfire’s spells and abilities for 1 minute. A creature adjacent to that pillar can also just make out the objects inside it (see Treasure below). The pillar must be smashed open to retrieve them.</p>\n<p>The second unusual stasis chamber, in the southwest, looks like the other empty chambers. However, its top and floor are both illusions. An open area below the chamber’s “floor” leads to a 5-foot-wide crawl space to the open trapdoor in area @UUID[.lNmEdSB5CToA5aKq]{G21}.

Yet, as with most rivers, predators lurk along these perilous banks. Night hags, astradaemons, devourers, and worse stalk the River, eager to pluck souls free and feed on them. Dread Nhimbaloth, the Empty Death, doesn’t deign to hunt the shores of the River of Souls alongside these predators—she instead feeds upon the predators themselves, reveling in consuming souls already being digested in the gullets of those who would deem themselves the apex hunters of the dead.</p>\n<p>Nhimbaloth uses the shores of the River of Souls to manifest upon the universe’s countless worlds, but she can’t just do so whenever she wills it. Before the Empty Death can manifest within a world, it must first endure a cataclysm so vast that the outflow of the dead into the River of Souls weakens the boundaries between life and death. When such massive casualties sufficiently thin these borders, she can drift in through the cracks and stain what she finds. The resulting blurring between the River of Souls and its shore is metaphysically akin to the muddied boundary of a swamp. It’s no coincidence that when Nhimbaloth emerges into a world, she chooses to dwell in its remote swamplands. Nhimbaloth isn’t a glutton—she’s endlessly patient and can linger on a world for centuries before being noticed.</p>\n<p>More often, her presence in an isolated swampland simply festers, turning a region of natural beauty into a dangerous fen that draws all manner of monsters to its fetid heart. Such lands call to will-o’-wisps; for these feeders of fears, the ruin wrought by the Empty Death is like a fine wine of unparalleled vintage. In time, many of these wisps realize the truth of the influence in their chosen haunts, and in most cases, these ravenous aberrations become Empty Death’s most fervent worshippers.</p>\n<figure class=\"right\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/vignettes/nhimbaloth.webp\" width=\"300\" /></figure>\n<h1>Personification and Realm</h1>\n<p>While Dread Nhimbaloth has no physical body of her own, she has been known to manifest a perceivable shape under the perfect conditions, growing visible after consuming a huge quantity of souls the way an empty glass’s contours becomes more defined once filled with liquid. In this form, Nhimbaloth appears as a twisting, melted mass of glistening blue fluid with eyes the shape of yellow four-pointed stars and a tangle of translucent tentacles extending in every direction. The tentacles’ tips split into seven smaller tendrils, and where these “hands” touch the world, they leave her mark behind—a ring of seven strange divots where vegetation refuses to grow, stone becomes chalky, and flesh festers as if it had forgotten how to heal. The position of the stars in the sky, the number of dead trapped within the swamp, and the time of year all seem to play a part in determining when this shadow of what might have once been Nhimbaloth’s body can appear, as does the presence of her cultists, but the manifestation rarely persists for long. Always, the manifestation ends in a sudden consumption from within when the Empty Death retreats to her domain, leaving behind a dead swampland of toxic waters and mindless undeath.</p>\n<p>This form often appears in illustrations that depict the Empty Death, though Nhimbaloth is also portrayed as a ghostly human woman with a single yellow eye in the shape of a four-pointed star filling her otherwise blank face, and a long, writhing mane of ghostly, seven-fingered tentacles wraps around her nearly skeletal body in a smoky shroud. This version of her is surely the product of an artist’s nightmare, yet cults have adopted it as their own.</p>\n<p>Nhimbaloth’s realm is a twofold domain. She uses the banks of the River of Souls as a hunting ground and a highway to travel from world to world, but supposedly dwells on a distant, dead planet. The name of this domain has been lost to time; the faithful of Nhimbaloth refer to it in whispers only as Voidbracken. Here, an ancient battle between Nhimbaloth and another power took place (most myths suggest her foe was Pharasma) that resulted in the destruction of the Empty Death’s body. This conflict didn’t result in her death, however, and her cult fondly views the event as an evolution—for without a body, she could now come and go as she pleased along the shores of the River of Souls. Voidbracken spins still in the Dark Tapestry, wandering aimlessly through the universe but driven always by Nhimbaloth’s will, and when it draws near an inhabited system, the souls of the living are drawn from their mortal shells in a cataclysm referred to in rare surviving accounts as the Deadtide. According to certain passages scribed in ancient texts like the Necronomicon, many of the Great Old Ones and Outer Gods must wait for the stars to align just right to manifest. This is quite literally true in Nhimbaloth’s case. Eventually, her Deadtides will claim enough lives so that Nhimbaloth’s death will die; the accumulated spiritual energy she has digested will ultimately undo her ancient defeat, allowing her to once more exist as a physical being.</p>\n<p>She will rise from death hungrier than ever.</p>\n<h1>Dogma and Worshippers</h1>\n<p>Nhimbaloth’s creed and worship are entirely the product of her cultists, as the Empty Death has little interest in providing her worshippers with direct inspiration or direction. This tradition echoes the pattern established with all other cults centered on entities of the Elder Mythos who similarly care not for their worshippers. Because of this lack of divine direction, while their worshippers strive to accomplish specific goals, they aren’t limited by anathemas.</p>\n<p>In Nhimbaloth’s case, her worshippers seek to create undead—particularly ghosts and other incorporeal creatures—to provide sustenance for their eldritch icon. They also feast upon carnivores at their ceremonies, aping Nhimbaloth’s predation upon soul-eating monsters. Her faith is all but unknown in urban areas, but in isolated swamp villages, worship of the Empty Death can suffuse entire settlements. In such instances, the cult typically builds the shell of a mainstream church to serve as a front and satisfy any curious outsiders passing through, while worshipping their goddess at a hidden location in the heart of the night.</p>\n<p>Lower-level clerics of Nhimbaloth dress in whatever corpse’s attire is commonly used in their society’s burial rites, choosing to wear a “final suit” or “last gown” during their rituals in hopes that sweet oblivion might answer their prayers. Cult leaders, however, often eschew this tradition, instead wearing dark green or gray hooded robes adorned with tangled sheets of clinging moss and skull-shaped masks adorned with veils of additional moss. The cultists favor flails in combat; these weapons often have heads shaped into four-pointed stars with the flail’s chain attached to the center of the star and handles wrapped in moss and tanned flesh stripped from the dead.</p>\n<p>Humanoids are far from the Empty Death’s only worshippers. As mentioned, will-o’-wisps and their kin find much to admire in the sinister aura Nhimbaloth’s presence brings to desolate swamplands, and it doesn’t take long for them to take up faith in the Empty Death, almost as if feeding on fear spurred by her influence infects the wisps with devotion to her faith. Marsh giants have also been known to venerate Nhimbaloth under names like “Bogmother,” “The Rushlight Woman,” “Swampfire Queen,” or the like, although they pray to her more as a patron of swampland than anything else. Vampiric mists commonly appear in her swamplands as well, and many scholars have nervously wondered about the implied connection between Nhimbaloth’s mark and the clusters of seven perfectly spaced punctures vampiric mists leave in the bodies of those they’ve fed upon through their misty tendrils.</p>\n<h1>Temples and Shrines</h1>\n<p>Often, the members of a cult of the Empty Death consist of the truly desperate, those with little money and less hope. They conduct their worship in their homes, or what passes as a home—partially collapsed shacks, abandoned barns, or even slumped survivalists’ shelters all suffice for the worship of Nhimbaloth. The rarer cults led by deviants of means construct larger structures to honor Nhimbaloth and often build these structures as mockeries of other churches by including stained glass windows, mosaics, and other works of art that honor the Outer Goddess. In such cases, the structure often serves a secondary purpose, such as a castle, a manor house, or the like. Curiously, these larger structures often share a particular feature: a tower that serves as a beacon or lighthouse as a way to honor will-o’-wisps, which the cult adore. To her followers, will-o’-wisps are Nhimbaloth’s eyes, and her gaze looks out upon the world through the lambent glow of these supernatural predators. A beacon or lighthouse in a temple thus symbolizes a will-o’-wisp, but also, they believe it gives Nhimbaloth a lens through which to gaze upon the world.</p>\n<p>Nhimbaloth’s symbol is a skull with moss stuffed into its jaws, although her cultists often create variants of it as crude dolls or effigies of moss-caked bones and fragments of skulls. Temples that can afford to be open about their affiliation with the goddess often adorn their structures with skulls that have moss carefully grown into soggy, vermin-infested beards or with moss draperies that hang down over archways to form moist curtains in place of proper doors.</p>\n<h1>A Priest's Role</h1>\n<p>As with most cults of the Elder Mythos, the majority of Nhimbaloth’s devout don’t worship out of respect or adoration so much as fear. For them, the concept of death isn’t what evokes nightmare, but the fear of what judgment might await in the afterlife is what drives most to her faith. Those who have sinned, who have committed heresy against a prior faith, or who simply live in constant terror of what Pharasma might say to them when they reach her throne instead seek the oblivion offered by Nhimbaloth. They seek not to escape death or life, but to escape what they fear will be an even worse afterlife.</p>\n<p>Yet this is not the only motive that draws worshippers to her fold. Some, rather than being driven by a fear of the afterlife, are enticed by the opportunity to bask in the misery and despair of others. These members are some of the most awful in the sect, for they use the promise of oblivion that Nhimbaloth offers to those who worship her as a lure to draw in the desperate to aid their own nefarious plots. Some seek to use these eager-for-oblivion zealots as disposable armies for acts of vengeance or rage; others draw upon these worshippers as sacrifices to fuel abhorrent rituals or to craft horrific magic items.</p>\n<p>Even these predators of the desperate pale in comparison to the worst of Nhimbaloth’s worshippers—nihilists who fully understand the Empty Death and see in her the ultimate tool to destroy a world they’ve grown to loathe. For these cultists, nothing less than using the Voidbracken to bring a Deadtide upon their world will suffice. They might have a hidden plan to escape the world the moment all life is ended; they might even seek their own oblivion or believe that Nhimbaloth herself might reward them with dominion over a dead world. Regardless of their intent, these doomsday shepherds are the most dangerous of the Empty Death’s worshippers.</p>\n<h1>Holidays</h1>\n<p>Cults of Nhimbaloth that exist in small communities under the guise of a different religion take pains to observe that faith’s holidays if visitors or (more rarely) townsfolk don’t know their gathering’s true faith, but apart from that, worshippers of the Empty Death don’t observe regular holidays or religious festivals—with one unusual exception. The exact date on which Nhimbaloth’s body was taken from her and Voidbracken was denuded of life is unknown, so each cult chooses one day of import to observe this anniversary. The fact that no one knows the length of Voidbracken’s year makes this ritual even more arbitrary; regardless, her faithful believe that on one of these so-called Void Dawns, the sun won’t rise upon the world and all life will be snuffed in a Deadtide. Cultists celebrate the night leading to a Void Dawn with a gluttonous feast consisting of all manner of carnivores and monsters—meals they often make during the proceedings while the “food” still lives. When the sun inevitably rises, the cultists choose one of their own as the final feast in atonement for failing to bring the Deadtide to their world.</p>\n<h1>Aphorisms</h1>\n<p>Worshippers of Nhimbaloth fondly quote and recite their favorite tales from The Whispering Reeds, each of which has a number of memorable and haunting lines. However, a variant of an infamous quote from the Necronomicon particularly resonates with all of her worshippers.</p>\n<p><em><strong>\"Long Dream the Dead, Yet Even Death Can Die\"</strong></em></p>\n<p>To many, the notion of death is akin to an eternal slumber, a dawnless rest in which the soul experiences an afterlife in the way a sleeping person could dream several different lives in the span of a single night. Whether a dreamer wakes with the dawn or dies in their sleep, all dreams eventually come to an end. Just as when the Empty Death comes to call, even death knows oblivion—and even death may die.</p>\n<h1>Holy Text</h1>\n<p>Mentions of Nhimbaloth are rare, even for the esoteric topic of the Outer Gods. The dread Necronomicon mentions her, and certain translations of that book purportedly contain descriptions of her true form, which might be the only place where Nhimbaloth’s true form is set down in print. This information isn’t even present in the text most often associated with her worship: a rare tome called <em>The Whispering Reeds</em>.</p>\n<p>The genesis of <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> lies not in those who worship the Empty Death, but in those who sought to oppose her. The book consists of stories, myths, parables, and encounters with Nhimbaloth gathered from hundreds of regions in dozens of worlds. The compiler’s name has been long forgotten, as they neglected to name themself in the text. This matters not to those who worship Nhimbaloth, nor does the fact that the author originally penned the book for the purpose of cataloging the ways in which Nhimbaloth’s influence could be opposed. The very act of collecting these old stories of the Empty Death brushing against the world had the opposite effect, and now, those who seek to draw their goddess’s attention to their world uses <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> to spread stories of her previous visits.</p>\n<h1>Relations with Other Religions</h1>\n<p>Nhimbaloth doesn’t consort with other gods, although often her visitations upon the wilderness force confrontations with other faiths. In particular, Gozreh and Desna oppose her influence—the former because of the proliferation of unnatural elements that taint swamplands, and the latter out of a mixture of anger and fear that her flock might stumble into Nhimbaloth’s clutches accidentally while exploring the wilds. The Eldest of the First World also oppose Nhimbaloth, whose parasitic tendrils can occasionally drift into that plane through fey gates and portals. Even after driving out the Empty Death, small cults of fey who have fallen under her sway inevitably remain.</p>\n<p>Pharasma opposes Nhimbaloth for multiple reasons. Those who perish in lands haunted by the latter’s presence tend to rise as ghosts. Moreover, the Empty Death’s habit of consuming those ghosts has rightly angered Pharasma, for rather than being released to the Boneyard, the consumed souls simply disappear. One might assume that such an affront to the cycle of life and death would compel Pharasma into a direct confrontation with Nhimbaloth, and indeed, certain ancient texts tell of such a clash between the two goddesses at the very dawn of mortal civilization. The titanic battle left neither goddess the victor. Nhimbaloth learned to hide her predations upon the world so that even Pharasma can’t readily find her, and one particularly blasphemous tale in The Whispering Reeds speaks of a hidden scar that Pharasma bears to this day as a reminder of her failed attempt to decisively defeat the Empty Death—a scar, supposedly, in the pattern of seven divots of flesh where Nhimbaloth fed upon the essence of the Goddess of Death.</p>\n<p>Whether or not this myth has any basis in fact, the faithful of Pharasma view Nhimbaloth and her cult with a combination of hatred and fearful respect. Only the most devout and powerful of Pharasma’s worshippers receive leave to hunt Nhimbaloth’s faithful, and they work hard to prevent lay worshippers from learning much of the Empty Death. Their justification—that Nhimbaloth feeds only on ghosts, and that by defeating or preventing the formation of theses undead, they strike blows against the Empty Death—reads to some as an excuse.</p>\n<section class=\"compartment\">\n<article class=\"full\">\n<h3>Nhimbaloth's Inspiration</h3>\n<p>H.

While many monsters beneath the citadel died, others have prospered, and now several communities of morlocks, urdefhans, ghouls, and stranger creatures call the dungeons home. Only the longest-lived remember any life other than the dungeons. Belcorra had bound several devils to serve her as overseers and administrators, and many of these still maintain order. Apart from the regions maintained by these devils and a drow outpost in one of the lowest levels, the Abomination Vaults are lawless and dangerous.</p><h2>Wandering Monsters</h2><p>While this book doesn’t present wandering monster tables for Abomination Vaults, the dungeon’s denizens still occasionally leave their homes! You can make the dungeon feel more dynamic by familiarizing yourself with each level’s denizens and then having them react to the party’s progression and presence. For example, if the heroes noisily explore an area, creatures in nearby rooms could come to investigate or perhaps set up an ambush. If the heroes decide to camp out in the dungeon rather than return to the safety of town, nearby creatures might visit or even attack their campsite while they rest. If the heroes clear out the denizens of a level and then return weeks later, they might find that new monsters have moved in. By keeping the inhabitants of the Abomination Vaults active, you can make the location feel all the more dangerous and unpredictable to your players.</p><h2>Beyond Gauntlight</h2><p>The ruins of Gauntlight Keep aren’t far out of town—just a 20-minute walk from Otari to the ruins. The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path focuses almost entirely on the dungeon itself, and you can gloss over the details of trips between the dungeon and town as you see fit. If your players express interest in mixing things up, you can use some of the encounters or short adventures in the standalone Pathfinder Adventure: Troubles in Otari.

Since their lost friend’s fondest dream had been to settle down in a small seaside village, they named this new village after him.</p><p>For some decades, Otari prospered as a fishing village, though its population never grew beyond a hundred or so. The three surviving Roseguard adventurers lived to a ripe old age, ultimately passing away from natural causes—an accomplishment many adventurers never achieve.</p><h3 style=\"font-size:var(--h3-font-size);font-family:var(--h3-font)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--h3-font)\">Decline (4290-4294 AR)</span></h3><p>With the passing of the last Roseguard, Aesephna Menhemes, in 4290 AR, Otari's fortunes began to dwindle. Within the span of a few years, its citizens had all drifted elsewhere, and by 4294 AR the town was entirely empty.</p><figure><img class=\"light-writer\" src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/vignettes/dawnflower-night.webp\" width=\"700\" /></figure><h3>Stonescale Kobolds (4300-4310 AR)</h3><p>Otari lay abandoned for decades, before a group of kobolds called the Stonescales moved in. When the kobolds started luring in passing ships during bad weather to ambush their crews and steal their cargo, it didn't take long for new adventurers to arrive and vanquish them.</p><h3>Otari Rebuilt (4310-4721 AR)</h3><p>While the adventurers moved on soon thereafter, their backer, Maklanni Menhemes, remained behind. Maklanni, Aesephna's granddaughter, conceived a plan to revitalize Otari as a lumber town. It already contained dozens of buildings that only needed to be restored, after all, and the Osprey River remained ideal for a mill and lumberyard. However, one setback complicated Maklanni's plan- the steep slopes and cliffs surrounding Otari made transporting timber to the ocean difficult.</p><p>Maklanni's solution was ingenious- she constructed a wooden flume that allowed for the easy transport of lumber from the woods to her mill and, from there, down an astounding loading ramp that extended from the top of the 200-foot-tall cliff to the harbor below. The mill and flume made Maklanni wealthy and revitalized Otari, although it made her an enemy of the Kortos Consortium, which had a stranglehold on the island's lumber industry. Two other small lumber companies broke from the Kortos Consortium and settled in Otari as well, each paying for use of Maklanni's invention.</p><h3>Otari Today</h3><p>Today, Otari is a thriving settlement- the largest on the coast between Absalom and Diobel. Maklanni is long dead, but her descendant @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.WirKAYn5ZGirmgjb]{Oseph Menhemes} carries on the family trade and also serves as the town's mayor. Unsavory representatives of the Kortos Consortium have secretly infiltrated Otari and seek to undermine the town's security. However, a far greater threat looms over the city: Belcorra has returned and is preparing to light the baleful fires of <em>Gauntlight</em> once again!</p><figure><img class=\"light-writer\" src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/vignettes/otari-docks.webp\" width=\"700\" /></figure>","markdown":""},"_id":"2YSUnF5ntWvt1fQu","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1150000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YD0CYhIgKe2Nd1aQ.JournalEntryPage.2YSUnF5ntWvt1fQu"}}},{"name":"Exploring Otari","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>Otari's Key Locations</h1>\n<p>Significant locations in Otari are detailed in the journals in the Otari Locations folder of your journals sidebar tab. These location descriptions are also pinned to the scene as map pins. Unlabeled buildings are wooden homes whose inhabitants work for nearby businesses or for one of the town's three lumber concerns.</p>\n<h2>Location Statistics</h2>\n<p>Many significant locations include statistics that help to communicate the general function and level of the location or business, for the purpose of determining any necessary values associated with it, such as the highest level task available to Earn Income. All of this information is included in the location's journal entry, as well as the address, wares, and services for sale (such as spellcasting services), as well as information about the most significant NPC who lives or works at the establishment.</p>\n<h3>Otari's Characters</h3>\n<p>As well as a description and artwork, the journals will include some important details about the NPCs in each location. Their initial attitude condition to the heroes, along with DCs most likely to be useful when interacting with the NPC, will be especially important if the players would like to earn the support of the location, as outlined below.</p>\n<aside class=\"av-float-block\">\n<h3>Side Quests</h3>\n<p>Some of the locations in the Abomination Vaults list side quests the heroes can pick up, usually after interacting with an NPC or discovering a clue. If the heroes complete a side quest, they earn an XP award for a moderate accomplishment (30 XP) in addition to any rewards the side quest grants, such as treasure or useful information.</p>\n</aside>\n<h3>Earning Support</h3>\n<p>If a hero adjusts an NPC’s attitude condition to helpful (which might require completion of a listed task but usually requires successful Diplomacy checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression}), that NPC's location supports the party in certain exploration and downtime activities. The specific benefits are based on the location's traits and are listed below. This support generally lasts throughout the campaign, although you might decide certain actions lose a location's support. The heroes can be supported by multiple locations in town, so long as they make enough friends!</p>\n<h3>Location Traits</h3>\n<p>Some of these locations include traits which can be a useful shorthand for the kind of benefits that the heroes might get for earning the trust and support of the business owners. An explanation of these traits is contained below.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"trait\">Church</span></p>\n<p>Faithful characters whose beliefs align with those of the church’s NPC (at your discretion) are permitted to use the location’s resources to retrain more efficiently.

To the west, the cliffside rises to meet a well-cared-for graveyard.

This ingenious construction swiftly delivers lumber processed further inland at the mill to waiting ships below.</p><p>The people of Otari are friendly and welcoming for the most part, although they tend to react with reticence toward those they suspect hail from Absalom. Trade with Absalom is important, but the townsfolk are proud and feel no need to accommodate visiting “city folk.” People in Otari typically subsist on fish along with vegetables from local farms (primarily potatoes, carrots, and other root vegetables), but more unusual fare isn’t hard to get from Absalom.

Their adamant refusal to accept payment for their work on the system is a bold statement about the generosity of the Pathfinder community, and we look forward to working together with them for a long time to come.</p>\n<h3>Development Leads</h3>\n<p>Carlos Fernandez</p>\n<p>Kevin Hjelden</p>\n<p>Richard Simões</p>\n<h3>Data Entry Leads</h3>\n<p>Ian Blackstone</p>\n<p>Ian Hildebrandt</p>\n<h3>Community Manager</h3>\n<p>Viviane Charlier</p>\n<h3>Project Module Representative</h3>\n<p>Gunnar Busch</p>\n<h3>Project Manager</h3>\n<p>Tim Munsie</p>\n<h3>Past Project Manager</h3>\n<p>Nikolaj Andresen</p>\n<h3>Founding System Developer</h3>\n<p>Shaun Newsome</p>\n<p>And other contributors to the system too numerous to name.</p>"},"_id":"MxAqLYiK8UGqGqGs","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Licensing Information","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>This product is compliant with the Open Game License (OGL) and is suitable for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (Second Edition).</p>\n<h3>Product Identity</h3>\n<p>The following items are hereby identified as Product Identity, as defined in the Open Game License version 1.0a, Section 1(e), and are not Open Game Content: All trademarks, registered trademarks, proper nouns (characters, deities, locations, etc., as well as all adjectives, names, titles, and descriptive terms derived from proper nouns), artworks, characters, dialogue, locations, organizations, plots, storylines, and trade dress.

In any of these cases, Borbo finally goes silent and the heroes can speak to him in Common, Elven, or Goblin.

Empty Vault","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p class=\" box-text narrative\">This strangely shaped chamber is humid and oppressively clammy. The room’s four wings each contain a massive pool of bubbling swamp water. Flickering motes of light and darkness play underneath the surface of the pools. The chamber’s center is partially blocked by a circle of towering black standing stones, which crackle with eerie energy that shoots up into a shaft in the ceiling. Seven narrow channels, as though dug into the stone by a seven-fingered hand, run from each pool and three of the walls to a moat in the center of the room. From there, the water flows under the wall to the east, between a pair of black stone double doors. An island in the moat holds a smooth altar topped with a black lens the size of a fist.</p>\n<p>The Empty Vault has always been a generation pit for the wisps who serve Nhimbaloth. A funnel of swamp, despair, and ghostly energies, it’s mystically connected to the various swamp plant basins throughout the lower Abomination Vaults. Any follower of Nhimbaloth can telepathically communicate with wisps adjacent to the basins from here.</p>\n<p>The Empty Vault drew Belcorra’s soul after the Roseguard killed her, and her ghost reappeared here 500 years after the most traumatic event in her life—not her death, but her family’s exile from Absalom. Belcorra can’t leave this chamber for long, so she uses her wisp proxies and bound agents to enact her will throughout the Abomination Vaults. She keeps the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.CTiLugp5ptSItEqN]{Ebon Fulcrum Lens} on the altar to restore its energies; while here, it can regain its glimmers of Nhimbaloth’s essence, but this takes time.</p>\n<p>The seven swamp water rivulets are both dangerous and noxious, as they mark where Nhimbaloth once touched the world. It’s a simple matter to step over them, but they pull unpleasantly at the life energy of anyone who crosses them. At the end of any turn in which a hero crosses a rivulet (whether by Striding, Stepping, Flying, or any other means), the hero must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:22]{Fortitude} save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 1}. This DC increases by 2 for each additional unique rivulet crossed during that turn (for example, a hero who crosses over 3 rivulets in their turn must attempt a DC 26 Fortitude saving throw). The doomed condition is cumulative on subsequent rounds. Crossing the pools doesn’t have this effect, so the heroes might learn that there are safer ways to move about the room than simply walking in a direct line. The rivulets have no effect on followers of Nhimbaloth, including Belcorra and the dread wisps.</p>\n<p>The black stone menhirs help support Gauntlight’s weight and emit the twisting ribbon of eerie energy that writhes up the shaft through areas @UUID[JournalEntry.uMZ0RiCcPSqsx1Nm.JournalEntryPage.8pbhSFgv71lvCz9M]{B35}, @UUID[JournalEntry.KeWKr2yd8dbppeS5.JournalEntryPage.eOv6LI3wvIuKyyNJ]{C15}, @UUID[JournalEntry.FwWmtOBFHhvM2gtf.JournalEntryPage.rVwX8eSwEBHWEjcg]{H37}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.1vlzl3NJsftNB9Dc.JournalEntryPage.NaEg1IQHphXU25Nk]{I28}. Belcorra can manipulate this ribbon of energy to power Gauntlight.</p>\n<h1>The Final Battle</h1>\n<p>If the heroes defeat Belcorra shortly before they reach the Empty Vault, she uses the power of the Ebon Fulcrum Lens to hasten her rejuvenation so she can face them in her sanctum.</p>\n<p>Belcorra doesn't ever surrender or flee in the Empty Vault. The heroes could possibly face her here without yet having the ability to permanently defeat her. In this case, they'll need to retreat to collect the fulcrum lenses and return to face her again. Once the heroes can focus Nhimbaloth's gaze upon Belcorra, they can defeat the sorcerer for good.</p>\n<h2>Destroying Belcorra</h2>\n<p>Belcorra only stops rejuvenating once she completes her goal of inflicting murderous revenge upon Absalom—but there’s another way to end her villainy for good. Nhimbaloth, the devourer of spirits, can utterly annihilate the ghost so she troubles the world no longer. Drawing the reclusive and inhuman Nhimbaloth’s attention isn’t easy, but Belcorra laid the groundwork for this by relying so heavily upon the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.CTiLugp5ptSItEqN]{Ebon Fulcrum Lens}. Nhimbaloth is already inclined to turn her spirit-consuming attention to Belcorra because Belcorra has made frequent use of the glimmers of Nhimbaloth’s essence within the item. The heroes must strengthen this contact by imbuing Belcorra with the splinters of Nhimbaloth’s essence in the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.yAqGhT0GuZrkvWZl]{Crimson Fulcrum Lens}, the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.IS1P6er2hLyKXAss]{Emerald Fulcrum Lens}, and the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.I2ul8Bzcth7sleow]{Ochre Fulcrum Lens} (it’s easier to do so via the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.JwHNSaiwwqF7VCC5]{Fulcrum Lattice}, but that item isn’t strictly required). Each splinter gives Belcorra a bit more power, but all three together (building upon her past use of the Ebon Fulcrum Lens) draw Nhimbaloth’s dread gaze to her ghostly devotee.</p>\n<section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/icons/encounter/skull.webp\" width=\"100\" />\n<section>\n<h2>Encounter</h2>\n<h2>Extreme 10</h2>\n</section>\n<section>\n<div>\n<p>@Actor[DDJGNAh3rfyIupAb]{Belcorra Haruvex} @Actor[QnbMaJPU7jG4uhaC]{Soul Feeders (1 to 4)}</p>\n</div>\n<p>180 XP</p>\n</section>\n</header>\n<article>\n<p style=\"font-family:var(--main-font);font-size:var(--body-font-size)\">If Belcorra hasn’t yet rejuvenated, the Ebon Fulcrum Lens automatically rejuvenates her when the heroes arrive. She’s so incensed that another group of adventurers would dare to oppose her in her sanctum that she attacks with her full fury. Belcorra focuses her attacks on anyone who carries fulcrum lenses, especially a hero who carries them in the Fulcrum Lattice. She realizes that the lenses are potent weapons that can be used against her.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family:var(--main-font);font-size:var(--body-font-size)\">There’s one soul feeder here at all times. If the heroes presented souls to the soul feeders in area J8, they’ve come here and also fight at Belcorra’s side; this makes the encounter particularly challenging!</p>\n<p style=\"font-family:var(--main-font);font-size:var(--body-font-size)\">Belcorra and the soul feeders use the menhirs for cover as they dart about, hoping to draw the heroes over the doom-inducing rivulets of swamp water.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family:var(--main-font);font-size:var(--body-font-size)\">When the heroes infuse Belcorra with splinters in the Crimson Fulcrum Lens, the Emerald Fulcrum Lens, and the Ochre Fulcrum Lens, Nhimbaloth comes for her, and she’s forever destroyed. When the heroes do this, proceed to Nhimbaloth’s Entrance below.</p>\n</article>\n</section>\n<p><span style=\"color:var(--av-green);font-family:var(--h1-font);font-size:var(--h1-font-size);letter-spacing:0.1rem\">Nhimbaloth’s Entrance</span></p>\n<p>Once the heroes infuse Belcorra with all three of Nhimbaloth’s splinters, the earth shakes. A tremendous and hideous wail emanates from somewhere beyond this chamber—indeed, it seems, from beyond the Material Plane. All creatures in the Abomination Vaults must succeed a @Check[type:will|dc:30]{Will} save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 3} (a creature that critically fails is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} for [[/r 1d4]] rounds). At the start of the following round, Nhimbaloth’s essence pervades the room.</p>\n<p class=\" box-text narrative\">A terrible, blackish-gray mist seeps into the room. It stinks of a fetid bog and leaves a layer of cloying, slimy water upon everything it passes. The mist twists in shape and form, with seven-fingered tentacles appearing and disappearing in the fog.</p>\n<p>This misty incarnation can’t be attacked or damaged. It flows into Belcorra, who shrieks, “No! I deserve your power, not your attention! My death is full of rage and strength—it is not empty!” Despite these protestations, Belcorra’s form is pulled apart into the mist, and the mist vanishes.</p>\n<p>An immense grinding noise comes from high above. Gauntlight, Belcorra’s greatest work, is collapsing, one level at a time. With each passing round, the artifact drops one dungeon level along the lighthouse’s footprint (but not in the rest of the Abomination Vaults!), obliterating anything directly beneath it. In the 9th round, it collapses into this chamber, destroying everything here—by then, the heroes would best be gone.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>With Belcorra destroyed, Otari and Absalom are safe from her spiteful schemes. The heroes receive a warm welcome in Otari, and everyone wants to hear their tales over a friendly fire, good food, and more than a few drinks. The heroes are told, retold, and embellished upon for generations.</p>\n<p>Gauntlight is no more, and only the pit in the Fogfen marks the spot it once stood. The dangers lurking there might one day regain their strength and menace the surface—but those are tales for other heroes.</p>"},"_id":"a9b40LjI7QwLgirk","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":4000000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"name":"J: Temple","folder":"kqSC7kyzna6VbRpE","sort":41407,"ownership":{"default":0,"xOsB85wXI0jTccyw":3,"jKurw3jQyqNyDEa2":3},"flags":{"pf2e-abomination-vaults":{"isAV":true}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.8","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1667758089668,"modifiedTime":1682262673904,"lastModifiedBy":"jKurw3jQyqNyDEa2"},"_id":"yn21bNM6kpV4xRol"}
